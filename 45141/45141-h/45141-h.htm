<h2>I<br />
<br />
<small>INTRODUCING MR. MACHIAVELLI VAN DYCK</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> those who knew him best and had known
him longest, Bonteck Van Dyck, sometime captain
of his university eleven, a ball player with the
highest batting average on the university nine, a
large-lettered star in everything pertaining to athletic
accomplishments, and above and beyond this
the fortunate&mdash;or unfortunate, as one chooses to
view it&mdash;inheritor of the obese Van Dyck fortune,
figured, like the dead kitten discovered on the ash
heap by the investigative infant, as "a perfectly
good cat, spoiled."</p>

<p>As was most natural, the spoiling was usually
charged in a lump sum to the exaggerated fortune.
In the university Van Dyck was a breezy, whole-souled,
large-hearted man's man, the idol of his set
and fraternity and a pathetically easy mark for the
college borrower. Past the college period, however,
there came rumors of a radical change; sharp-edged
hints that the easy mark was becoming an
increasingly hard mark; vague intimations that
this prince of good fellows of an earlier day was
attaining a certain stony indifference to suffering
on the part of those who sought to relieve him of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
some portion of the money burden. Nay, more;
it was whispered that he was not above using the
bloated bank account as a club wherewith to dash
out the brains of his opponents, not only in the
market-place, but at the social fireside, where, as
a handsome young Croesus, owning a goodly handful
of Manhattan frontages, sailing his own yacht,
and traveling in his own private car, he was the
legitimate quarry of the match-making mothers&mdash;or
fathers.</p>

<p>Though we had been reasonably close friends in
the university days, it so chanced that I had seen
next to nothing of Van Dyck during the three
years immediately following the doling out of the
coveted sheepskins in Commencement Week; and
the echoes of these derogatory stories&mdash;echoes were
all that had drifted out to me in the foreign field
to which, as a constructing engineer, I had gone
soon after my graduation&mdash;were somehow vastly
unconvincing. But on a certain memorable autumn
evening in a New Orleans hotel, when I
found myself sitting across a table for two as Van
Dyck's guest, listening while he explained, or tried
to explain, why he had cabled me from Havana to
meet him at this particular time and place, it was
disconcertingly evident that the golden youth of
the old university days had really developed into
something different&mdash;different, and just a shade
puzzling.</p>

<p>"You see, Preble, you are the one man I was
most anxious to find," he was saying, for the third
time since the half-shell oysters had been served.
"By the sheerest good luck I happened to run
across Bertie Witherspoon in Havana, and he told
me that you were, or had been, running the blockade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
or something of that sort, down on the Venezuela
coast, and that a wire to the Barcado Brothers'
New Orleans headquarters would probably
reach you."</p>

<p>"Running the blockade!" I broke in derisively.
"That is about as near as a New York provincial
like Bertie Witherspoon could come to any fact
outside of his native Borough of Manhattan!
There is no blockade on the Venezuelan coast; and
I've been building a railroad from Trujillo up into
the Sierra Nevada de Merida. Does this trifling
difference make me any less the man you were
anxious to find?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," he returned, with the old-time,
boyish smile wrinkling at the corners of his
fine eyes. "But I do hope you've got your railroad
built and are footloose and free to take another
commission."</p>

<p>"No," I said; "the railroad isn't finished. But
as it probably never will be, under the present
Venezuelan administration, we can leave it out of
the question."</p>

<p>"Then you could take a month or so off, if you
should feel like it?"</p>

<p>"I could, yes; if the hotel bills wouldn't prove to
be too high."</p>

<p>Again the good-natured smile identified the Teck
Van Dyck of other days for me.</p>

<p>"There won't be any hotel bills," he said gently.
"You are to be my guest on the <i>Andromeda</i> for a
little cruise."</p>

<p>"On the <i>Andromeda?</i>" I exclaimed. "You don't
mean to say you've got that baby Cunarder with
you down here in these waters?"</p>

<p>"Yea, verily, and for a fact," was the smiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
reply. "I came up the big river in her this afternoon.
Been knocking about a bit among the
islands to dodge the country-house invitations up
home."</p>

<p>"Out of tune with the little social gods and
goddesses?" I ventured.</p>

<p>"Out of tune with a good many things, Dick.
This is a sorry old world, and the people in it are
sorrier&mdash;most of 'em. Everything's a bore."</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"Since when have you been soaking Diogenes
and the later Cynics?"</p>

<p>"Chortle if you want to," he returned. "Old
Man Socrates had it about right when he said that
virtue is knowledge, and Antisthenes went him
one better when he said, 'Let men gain wisdom&mdash;or
buy a rope.' Another time he says, 'A horse
I can see, but horsehood I can not see.' That
applies to humanity, as well."</p>

<p>"Meaning that things&mdash;and people&mdash;are not always
what they seem?"</p>

<p>"Meaning that people are so seldom what they
seem that you can ignore the exceptions. Somebody
has said that there are two distinct entities
in the ego; the man as he sees himself, and the
man as God sees him. That is only a fraction of
a great truth. There are as many entities as the
man has human contacts; he is not precisely the
same man to any two of his acquaintances, and he
is a hypocrite with most."</p>

<p>"Bosh!" said I, thinking I had the key to all
this hard-bitted, and lately acquired, philosophy.
"You have too much money, Bonteck; that is all
that is the matter with you."</p>

<p>He put down his oyster fork and looked me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
squarely in the eye. He was the same handsome,
upstanding young Hercules that he had always
been, but there was something new and more or
less provocative in the contemptuous set of the
mouth and the half belligerent emphasis of the
well-defined jaw.</p>

<p>"You've said it, Dick; I have too much money,
and other people haven't enough," was his rather
enigmatical retort. Then: "You may call it madman
raving if you like, but I've lost my sense of
perspective; I can't tell an honest man&mdash;or woman&mdash;when
I see one."</p>

<p>"All of which leads up to?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To the thing which has brought me to New
Orleans, and to my reason for wiring you from
Havana. My philosophy has led me to the jumping-off
place, Dick. Before I am two months
older I am going to know at least one small bunch
of people for what they really are under their
skins. And you are going to help me to acquire
this invaluable information. How does that proposal
strike you?"</p>

<p>"It strikes me a trifle remindfully, if you insist
on knowing," I said. "I haven't been altogether
out of touch with the home people, and quite a
few of them have had something to say about this
loss of perspective that you've just confessed to.
I've been writing most of the gossip off to profit
and loss, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You needn't," was his brusque interruption.
"As I've said, this is a pretty rotten world, if
anybody should ask."</p>

<p>"Is it, indeed? How many millions does it take
to give a man that point of view?"</p>

<p>"That is the devil of it," he said, with a touch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of bitterness. "Will you believe me when I say
that, apart from yourself and two or three other
honest money-despisers like you, I don't really
know, as man to man, or man to woman, half a
dozen people on the face of the planet?"</p>

<p>"I'll believe that you think so. Still, that is all
piffle, as you very well know. So far as the women
are concerned, it merely means that you haven't
met the one and only."</p>

<p>Van Dyck was silent while the waiter was placing
the meat course. During the plate-changing
interval I became unpleasantly conscious of the
presence&mdash;the curiously obtrusive presence&mdash;of a
dark-faced, black-mustachioed little man sitting
two tables away, and apparently engrossed in his
dinner. Why this one foreign-looking individual,
out of the many late diners comfortably filling the
large room, should disturb me, I could not determine;
but the vague disquietude came&mdash;and remained.
Twice I thought I caught the small man
watching my tablemate furtively from beneath his
heavy eyebrows; and when Van Dyck began to
speak again, I was almost certain I detected that
half mechanical cocking of an ear which betrays
the intentional and eager eavesdropper.</p>

<p>"The one and only woman," said Van Dyck
musingly, taking up the thread of the table talk
at the point where it had been broken by the
shifting of plates. "That is another exploded fallacy,
Preble. There are dozens of the 'one-and-onlys,'
each with a scheming mamma, or a grafting
father, or an impecunious guardian who has been
thriftlessly making ducks and drakes of his ward's
trust funds. And they are all so immitigably decent
and well-behaved and conventional that butter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
wouldn't melt in the mouth of a single one of them.
They never, by any chance, let you see one-sixty-fourth
of an inch below the surface."</p>

<p>"I grant you surfaces are more or less deceptive,"
I admitted. "But your charge is too sweeping.
You can't lump humanity any more than you can
the stars in heaven."</p>

<p>"Can't I? Wait and you shall see. And it
isn't altogether what you are thinking; that I have
been 'touched' so often that it has soured me.
Heaven knows I've been a perfect Pool of Bethesda
to a whole worldful of financial cripples ever since
I left the university; but I don't especially mind
the graft. What I do mind is the fact that it
makes smiling hypocrites out of the grafters, big
and little. Not one of them dares show me his
real self, and there are times when I am fairly sick
at heart for one little refreshing glimpse of humanity
in the raw."</p>

<p>"Which is more piffle," I commented. "You
didn't cable me to come and eat a New Orleans
dinner with you on the bare chance that I'd let
you work off a batch of grouches on me, did you?"</p>

<p>His answer was delayed so long that I wondered
if he were trying to determine beforehand how
much or how little he might be obliged to tell me.
But finally he broke ground, rather cautiously, I
thought, in the field of the explanations.</p>

<p>"No; I didn't ask you for the purpose of unloading
my peculiar and personal grievances upon you,
tempting as that may have been. I have a deep-laid
plot, and I want you to help me carry it out.
It is just about the maddest thing you ever heard
of, and I've got to have at least one sane man
along&mdash;as a sort of sea-anchor to tie to when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
hurricane begins ripping the masts out of us, and
all that."</p>

<p>"In other words, you are out to pick up a bit of
moral backing for the plot. Is that it?"</p>

<p>"You have hit it precisely. You are to go along
and hold me up to the mark, Dick. If I show any
signs of weakening, you are to jab a knife into me
and twist it around a few times. You are on
salary, you know&mdash;if you care to have it that way."</p>

<p>"If you say money to me again, I quit you cold,
right here and now," was my answer to that.
And then: "Pitch out and tell me: what is this
piratical scheme that you are afraid you may not
have the nerve to carry through?"</p>

<p>The plotter sat back in his chair, regarding me
through half-closed eyelids; and again I thought I
caught the dark-faced foreigner two tables distant
stealthily watching him.</p>

<p>"On the face of it, it looks almost as thrilling
as an old maids' tea party&mdash;and not any less conventional,"
Van Dyck began. "You have been
around and about a good bit in the Caribbean,
haven't you?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I might be able to pilot the <i>Andromeda</i>
into most of the well-known harbors, if I had
to," I boasted.</p>

<p>"Good. But you haven't been much out of the
regular steamer lanes?&mdash;or have you?"</p>

<p>"Now and then; yes. Once, when I was trying
to blow around from Carthagena to La Guaira in
a coasting schooner, our old tub of a wind jammer
was caught in a hurricane and piled up on a coral
reef. We were Crusoes on the ghastly little island
for nearly a month before a tramp steamer happened
along and saw our signals."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Van Dyck nodded as one who is hearing what
has been heard before.</p>

<p>"You wrote home about that adventure, as you
may, or may not, remember, and the story got
around to me. Afterward, I chanced to see in the
shipping news the report of the captain of the
tramp 'tanker' which had picked you up. Your
island wasn't down on any of the charts, and
Captain Svenson gave the latitude and longitude
as a matter of information. Have you any idea
what island it was&mdash;or is?"</p>

<p>"No. As you may imagine, I was only too glad
to see the last of it when we were taken off."</p>

<p>"It is said to be the Lost Island of the old
English plateship harriers&mdash;Sir Frankie Drake and
the rest," Van Dyck went on. "There is a story
that Drake once ran a Spanish treasure ship into
the lagoon which encircles the island, shot it full
of holes, and finally burned it after a siege lasting
a couple of days. The tale adds that during the
two-day fight the Spaniards had time to unload
and bury some of the gold bars in the galleon's
cargo. Drake tried to make his prisoners tell
what they had done with the treasure&mdash;so the
story goes&mdash;and when they proved obstinate he
sailed away and left them to starve. At a somewhat
later period the island appears in the legends
as 'Pirates' Hope'&mdash;place where the black-flag
rovers used to put in to refit. Nobody seems to
know why it hasn't been put down on the modern
charts."</p>

<p>I closed my eyes and a cold little chill ran up
and down my back. Van Dyck's yarn was probably
only a figment of the story-tellers, but it
brought back most vividly the memory of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
despairing month I had spoken of; the dragging
hours and days, the pinch of starvation, the hope
deferred as we stared our eyes out sweeping the
meeting line of sea and sky that never&mdash;until that
last welcome day&mdash;gave back a sign of the world
out of which we had been blotted. Also, the
story resurrected another memory, one which had
been almost forgotten with the lapse of time.
There had been relics on the island; a few bits of
the iron and woodwork of an ancient wreck, and
a few bleached bones&mdash;human bones. Still, I had
all the incredulity of one who had listened to many
marvelous tales of the sea.</p>

<p>"You can hear dozens of yarns like that about every
coral island and cay in the Caribbean," I said.</p>

<p>"I know," he agreed. "And on a pleasure voyage
it helps out wonderfully if you have some one
along who can tell them. How would the old
Spanish Main strike you as a winter cruising ground
for the good ship <i>Andromeda?</i>"</p>

<p>It was at this point that I began to see a few
rays of daylight&mdash;or thought I did.</p>

<p>"Show me the <i>Andromeda's</i> passenger list and I
can tell better," I laughed.</p>

<p>"Your fellow voyagers will be people you know,
or used to know&mdash;the majority of them," he returned;
then, with what seemed to be a curious
lack of enthusiasm, he enumerated them. "I've
invited the newly married Greys; the Ph.D. Sanfords;
Major Terwilliger and his nephew, Jerry
Dupuyster; Conetta Kincaide and her dragoness
aunt, Miss Mehitable; Madeleine Barclay and her
father; young Grisdale and his bull pup; and Hobart
Ingerson. And last, but by no means least,
Mrs. Eager Van Tromp and her three daughters."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Heavens!" I interjected. "Why didn't you
include all of New York, while you were about it?
Do you mean to tell me that you have all these
people with you in the <i>Andromeda?</i>"</p>

<p>"Not yet, but soon," he qualified. "They are
on the way down here in my private car. I'm
here to meet them, and so, by the same token,
are you."</p>

<p>"Good Lord! If you had hired a Hagenbeck to
make your collection it couldn't have been more
zoo-like! What under the sun were you thinking
of, Teck?"</p>

<p>"They are all people I'd like to know better,"
he rejoined half absently. "The 'collection,' as
you so scoffingly call it, was quite carefully chosen,
if you did but know it."</p>

<p>"But Ingerson!" I protested.</p>

<p>"I know. Ingerson is a brute, you would say;
and so would I, if I were on the witness stand and
obliged to testify. But in condemning him we
should be in the minority, Dick. He has the
<i>entrée</i> to the best houses in New York, and half of
the dowagers in that abandoned city would snap
at him for a son-in-law."</p>

<p>"That may well be. But to shut yourself up
with him in a yacht party for weeks on end&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your point is well taken. But you will remember
that I have admitted the madnesses from
start to finish. The vital thing, however, is this:
Will you consent to go along with us to add the
saving touch of sanity? Don't turn me down,
Dick," he added, and the adjuration was almost
a pleading.</p>

<p>"I'm not turning you down," I hastened to
say. "I am merely asking 'why?'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Van Dyck's face was a study in moody perplexity,
and he spoke slowly, almost hesitantly, when
he answered my query.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I can explain the exact
'why,' or give a logical reason, even to so good a
friend as you are, Dick. The winter-cruise notion
originated with Mrs. Van Tromp, I believe; and
she is responsible for the inclusion of the major
and his nephew. Also, she is the one who asked
me to invite Ingerson. She has been playing in
hard luck lately, and for the sake of her three
girls, who, in her point of view, have simply <i>got</i>
to marry money, she is obliged to keep the pace.
I suppose the prospect of a winter in Florida&mdash;the
four of them at Palm Beach, with no chance to
cut economical corners, you know&mdash;appalled her.
Besides, she knows the <i>Andromeda</i>, and the <i>Andromeda's
chef</i>. That goes a long way with as
good a trencherwoman as she is."</p>

<p>"That will do for a starter," I said. "Let us
say that Mrs. Van Tromp and her daughters are
bread-and-butter guests. But how about the
others?"</p>

<p>Van Dyck did not reply until after the deft
serving man had cleared the table and brought
the cigars.</p>

<p>"The others, with the possible exception of Billy
Grisdale, who is only an infant, are people with
whom I should like to become better acquainted,
as I have said."</p>

<p>"Which is still purer piffle," I put in. "You've
known all of them practically all your life. But
go on."</p>

<p>"I've known them, and I haven't known them,"
he asserted. "There are the Sanfords&mdash;the professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and his wife: they typify the older married
set, and the casual onlooker would say that they
try to give the impression that they are still satisfied
and happy. I should like to find out if they
really are satisfied and happy. Then there are
the Greys; they are still in the billing and cooing
stage: I'd like to see if it isn't possible for them
to get too much of each other when the doors are
all shut and locked and neither of them can duck
out for a breath of the fresh air of solitude."</p>

<p>"Jehu!" I muttered. "The blue-bearded old
gentleman of the Old-World legend wasn't in it
with you. Let's have the rest of it."</p>

<p>Van Dyck's smile barely missed being a saturnine
grin, and there was scarcely a suggestion of mirth
in it.</p>

<p>"Major Terwilliger poses as a generous, large-hearted
old rounder who is eventually going to
do something handsome for Jerry Dupuyster, his
sister's son. Privately, I have a notion that the
major's liberal fortune&mdash;which he promises to bestow
upon Gerald&mdash;is largely, if not wholly, a
myth, and that he is selfish enough to keep Jerry
dangling as a bait to the scheming mammas&mdash;and
aunts&mdash;for the social advantages and 'side' thereby
accruing to Jerry's uncle."</p>

<p>"Conetta Kincaide's aunt, for example?" I interpolated.</p>

<p>"Yes, Aunt Mehitable, if you like. And, this
being the case, I have a perfectly normal curiosity
to see what will happen when the dragoness gets
the major and Jerry in a clear field, with no possibility
of a breakaway for them, or of interference
with her dragonizing for her."</p>

<p>"Having already used Bluebeard, I'm out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
comparisons for you," I said. "What about the
Barclays, father and daughter?"</p>

<p>Van Dyck shook his head and the faintest possible
shadow of a frown came and sat between his
eyes.</p>

<p>"We needn't be ill-natured on the wholesale
plan," he evaded. "You wouldn't suspect a man
like Holly Barclay of offering his daughter to the
highest bidder, would you? Supposing we admit
that he has gone through the fortune that his
wife's father got together, and let it stand at that."</p>

<p>"You are not letting it stand at that," I countered
shrewdly.</p>

<p>"No, perhaps I am not," he admitted, after a
thoughtful pause. "I thought I should like to
prove or disprove a thing that I have heard, about
Holly Barclay&mdash;and Madeleine&mdash;and&mdash;well, you'll
guess it if I don't say it&mdash;about Ingerson."</p>

<p>"Again with the clear field and no favor, I suppose,"
I put in a bit savagely. Then: "Van Dyck,
you ought to be shot!"</p>

<p>He was glancing at his watch, and his smile
was wry.</p>

<p>"I shall get my little drink of hemlock before
the table is cleared, never fear," he said soberly.
"Any time you may think I am not getting it,
you have my permission to blow the gaff; to call
the others together and tell them what I've done
to them. That is fair, isn't it?"</p>

<p>I nodded, and again he relapsed into thoughtful
silence. Our dinner appointment had been for a
rather late hour in the evening, and by now the
great dining-room was all but empty, though the
small dark-faced man on our right was still dallying
with the sweets and the black coffee. A heavy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
intoxicating fragrance drifted across from the flowering
cereus in the palm room, and the distance-mellowed
strains of an orchestra playing in an
alcove on the opposite side of the rotunda added
another sensuous touch. The glamour of the tropics,
a far-reaching breath of the beckoning mystery
of shimmering seas, and coral reefs singing to the
beat of the murmuring surf&mdash;the mystery whose
appeal is ever and most strongly to the senses and
the passions&mdash;was in the air when I said, gravely
enough, I make no doubt:</p>

<p>"I'll go with you, Bonteck; and chiefly for the
reason you have just given&mdash;the reason and the
permission. Let this be your fair warning: if at
any time your little farce threatens to grow into
a tragedy, I shall most certainly call you down."</p>

<p>"I was rather hoping you'd say something like
that," he agreed, with what appeared to be the
utmost sincerity.</p>

<p>"At the same time," I went on, "it is only fair
to add that your expensive experiment will fail.
Nothing will happen on the <i>Andromeda</i> that
couldn't, or wouldn't, happen in a house party at
your country place in the Berkshires. You will
come back as wise&mdash;or as foolish&mdash;as you are now."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he said, pushing his chair back and
casting the napkin aside, "we needn't pull the bud
in pieces to find out what kind of a flower it's
going to be. I can't promise you that you will
be greatly edified, and it is quite within the possibilities
that you may find yourself frightfully bored.
But, in any event, it will help out a little if we
leave something to the imagination, don't you
think?&mdash;something to speculate about and to look
forward to. I know it does look rather cut-and-dried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
in the prospect; eight bells breakfast, luncheon
when you like to have it, dinner in the second dog-watch,
and cards&mdash;always cards when Mrs. Van
Tromp can find a partner and a table&mdash;in the
evening."</p>

<p>He had got upon his feet and was standing before
me, an acutely attractive figure of a well-built,
well-groomed man in faultless evening dress. The
identifying smile of other and less cynical days
was drawing at the corners of his eyes when he
went on.</p>

<p>"We'll live in hopes. Perhaps we shall be able
to smash the <i>Andromeda</i> on some reef that isn't
down on the charts. Failing that, there is always
the chance of a stray hurricane&mdash;with the other
chance of the engines breaking down at the inopportune
moment. We shall find excitement of
some kind; I can feel it in my bones."</p>

<p>"Small chance on a baby Cunarder," I grumbled,
rising in my turn.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," he offered, in gentle deprecation.
"At any rate we can still be hopeful.
Now if you are ready we'll go to the railroad
station and meet the players. I told you they
were on the way down from New York, but I
omitted to add that they are due to arrive to-night;
within fifteen or twenty minutes, to be
strictly accurate. Let's gather up a few for-hire
autos and go to the rescue."</p>

<h2>II<br />
<br />
<small>THE SHIP'S COMPANY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were on the sidewalk&mdash;"banquette," as it
is called in New Orleans&mdash;in front of the hotel,
and Van Dyck was marshaling a number of vehicles
for a descent upon the railroad station, when
a small man with his soft hat pulled well down over
his eyes appeared at my elbow as silently as if
he had materialized out of the rain-wet pavement.</p>

<p>"Pardon, M'sieu'," he murmured, in the broken
English which placed him, apparently, as a native
of the French quarter, "ze brother of my cousin
ees h-ask me to fin' out for heem w'en M'sieu'
Van Dyck's steamsheep comes on N' Orlean.
'Ees h-oncle been de <i>chef</i> h-on dat sheep, an'
'ee's want sand heem lettaire. <i>Oui.</i>"</p>

<p>Van Dyck had started his procession of cabs,
and he called to me as the last of the vehicles
pulled up to the curb to take us in. Almost mechanically
I gave the soft-spoken and apologetic questioner
his answer.</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Dyck's yacht came up the river
to-day. Tell your cousin's brother he will have
to hurry his letter. The <i>Andromeda</i> will sail either
to-night or to-morrow morning, I believe."</p>

<p>It was not until after I had joined Van Dyck
in the waiting taxi, and we were sluing and skidding
over the wet pavements on the way to the railroad
station, that my companion said: "Didn't I see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
you talking to a little fellow in gray tweeds and a
soft hat just before we drove away from the hotel?
Do you know the man?"</p>

<p>"No; he was a stranger to me," I returned.
"He asked a question and I answered it. He is
the man who sat two tables away on your right in
the hotel dining-room. He said he was the cousin
of a cousin of somebody who wanted to send a
letter to the <i>Andromeda's</i> cook, and he wanted to
know when the yacht would arrive."</p>

<p>"You told him the <i>Andromeda</i> is already here?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's a bit odd," was Van Dyck's comment.</p>

<p>"What is odd?"</p>

<p>"That this little sallow-faced fellow should turn
up here in New Orleans practically at the same
moment that I do. I spotted him while we were
at dinner and wondered if he could be the same
one."</p>

<p>"The same one as who? And why shouldn't
he be here?" I asked, rather more than mildly
curious.</p>

<p>"The same one I have seen at least twice before
in the past few weeks. The first time was at our
anchorage in the Hudson when he, or somebody
very much like him, was the last man overside
as we were leaving port a month ago. I understood
then that he was a friend of some member of the
<i>Andromeda's</i> crew and had come aboard for a
farewell visit."</p>

<p>"And the second time?"</p>

<p>"The second time was some three weeks later,
and the place was Havana. There he, or again
somebody exactly like him, was hanging around the
water front chinning with any member of the crew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
who happened to have shore leave. That time he
wasn't trying to mail a letter; he was trying to
find out why it had apparently taken us three
weeks, instead of something less than one, to make
the run down from New York to Cuba."</p>

<p>"Did he find out?" I inquired, with a little
private wonderment of my own to prompt the
query.</p>

<p>"I can't say as to that," was Van Dyck's half-guarded
reply. "What is puzzling me now is his&mdash;er&mdash;omnipresence,
so to speak. So far as I
know, we left him in Havana. How does he come
to be here in New Orleans on the very day of our
arrival?"</p>

<p>"That is easy," I said; "the method, I mean&mdash;not
his object. He could have come by railroad
from Key West in less time than it took the
<i>Andromeda</i> to steam across the Gulf."</p>

<p>"Of course," Van Dyck agreed, quite as if this
simple explanation had not occurred to him. And
then, since we had reached the station, where, upon
inquiry, we found that the New York train was
already in, there was time only for a hospitable
dash to the platform upon which our prospective
ship's company was at the moment debarking.</p>

<p>Though I knew all of Van Dyck's guests well
enough to need no introductions, the mob of them
that was pouring out of the private car <i>Kalmia</i> was
overwhelming by sheer weight of numbers.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" I said to Van Dyck as we came
upon the scene, "I don't wonder that you wanted
help," and therewith we plunged in to bring order
out of the platform chaos of mingled humanity
and hand baggage.</p>

<p>It was after we had the human part of the chaos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
marching, with an army of laden red-caps, upon
the line of chartered taxis, that Van Dyck thrust
a sheaf of baggage checks into my hand.</p>

<p>"Be a good fellow, Dick, and see to it that the
heavy dunnage gets started for the <i>Andromeda's</i>
wharf before you leave, won't you?" he asked.
"I'll go on with the crowd, and have one of the
taxis wait for you&mdash;T. and P. wharf, foot of Thalia
Street, you know."</p>

<p>That was how it came about that I was left alone
to wrestle with the baggage-masters and the transfer
people, and after I had seen the last truck-load of
steamer trunks sorted, tarpaulined, and started on
its way over town, I returned to the cab rank and
found my taxi awaiting me, as Van Dyck had
promised.</p>

<p>It was not until I was climbing into the covered
cab that I discovered that it was already occupied.
As I ducked for shelter from the rain, which was
now falling smartly, a voice that I should have
recognized if I had heard it on another planet
said, "I hope you found my little green trunk
with the others. It has all my dinner gowns
in it."</p>

<p>"Conetta!" I gasped; and then I saw what
Van Dyck had done, either with malice aforethought
or in sheer heedlessness. In the taxicab loading
there had been an overflow of one, and Conetta
Kincaide had been left behind to share the waiting
vehicle with me.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you knew this was my cab?" I stammered,
after I had accumulated wit enough to
shut the door and tell the driver to go on.</p>

<p>"Of course. Bonteck put me in and said you'd
be along in a few minutes; that you'd gone to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
after the baggage. How do you happen to be here
with Bonteck?"</p>

<p>"That," I evaded, "is a rather tedious story.
Later on you may have it for what it is worth,
if you still care to hear it. Excuse me a moment,"
and I leaned forward and stuck my head through
the open window at the taxi-driver's ear to whisper:
"Take your time, and don't bother to make any
short cuts."</p>

<p>"What was that you were saying to the man?"
was the question I had to answer after I had fallen
back into the seat beside the possessor of the cool
voice and self-contained manner.</p>

<p>"I was telling him he needn't hurry," I confessed
brazenly. "In a few minutes you will be
one of the crowd again, and there are three years
to be bridged, in some fashion, in those few minutes."</p>

<p>I felt, rather than heard, her little gasp of dismay.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that&mdash;that you are going
along in the <i>Andromeda?</i>" she asked faintly.</p>

<p>"It is even so&mdash;more is the pity. I had committed
myself to Bonteck, in a way, before I knew
the names on his passenger list."</p>

<p>"And if you had known, you would have refused?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Most likely I should; and not
altogether out of consideration for you. You see,
I am quite frank."</p>

<p>"You are; most refreshingly frank. One might
have hoped that time, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>----"And absence and new fields and faces, and
all that, would make me forget," I finished for her.
"Unhappily, they haven't. But that is neither
here nor there. Though I have kept pretty well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
out of the civilized world for the past three years,
there has been a word now and then from home.
Tell me plainly, Connie&mdash;how much does Jerry
Dupuyster know?"</p>

<p>"He knows that three years ago we were engaged
to be married, you and I." The cool voice trembled
a little, but it was still well under control.</p>

<p>"That is better," I commented with a sigh of
relief; and it was better because, if Jerry hadn't
known, there would have been chances for hideous
complications on the proposed cruise of the <i>Andromeda</i>,
or at least, in some inchoate way, I felt
there would. "Does Jerry know why it was
broken off?" I went on.</p>

<p>"He thinks he does."</p>

<p>"Which is to say that he accepts your Aunt
Mehitable's version of it; the one she published
broadcast among our friends&mdash;that, without any
cause assigned, we simply agreed to disagree?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>Silence for a square or so, broken only by the
drumming of the taxi's motor. Then I took the
bull by the horns.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell Bonteck that, for reasons which I
don't care to explain, I shall have to drop out of
this badly mixed ship's company of his?"</p>

<p>The cool voice had fully regained its even tones
when she said: "Why should you?"</p>

<p>"There is no 'why' unless you care to interpose
one of your own making. But I should think, with
Jerry Dupuyster along&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The <i>Andromeda</i> is a reasonably roomy little
ship," was the calm retort. "And, besides, there
are enough of us to afford protection&mdash;the protection
of a crowd. If you have promised Bonteck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
you can hardly break with him at the last moment,
can you?"</p>

<p>"You don't care, then?"</p>

<p>"Why should I care? What is done is done, and
can't be helped. Aunt Mehitable thinks I ought
to marry; I suppose she thinks I owe it to her to
marry and set up an establishment of my own. Perhaps
I do owe it to her. I've been a charge upon
her generosity all my life."</p>

<p>"So you are going to marry Jerry Dupuyster,
a lisping club-lizard who apes the English so hard
that he forgets that he has a string of American
ancestors as long as your arm?" I flamed out.</p>

<p>"Well, if I am, what is it to you, Dick Preble?
Or to any one else besides Jerry and me? Also,
I might ask what right I have given you to put me
upon the rack?"</p>

<p>"None; none whatever," I admitted gloomily.
"Still, I have a right, of a sort&mdash;the right of the
first man. You seem conveniently and successfully
to have forgotten. Unfortunately, I haven't
been able to forget, though I have tried all of the
customary antidotes."</p>

<p>"Other women?" she asked, with the faintest
possible touch of malice.</p>

<p>I was resentful enough to meet her baldly upon
her own ground.</p>

<p>"There was a young woman in Venezuela; a
pure Castilian, with the blood of kings in her
veins. I could have married her."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you?" she asked sweetly.</p>

<p>"I have wished many times that I had. I
wonder if you can understand if I say that I was
afraid?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Kipling says that we can't understand&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
we can never understand. But I think I
know what you mean. You may have been Adam&mdash;the
first man, again&mdash;for her; but she wasn't,
and never could be, Eve&mdash;the first woman&mdash;for
you. Was that it?"</p>

<p>The taxi was finally approaching the quarter of
the city in which our wharf lay. There were
other things to be said, and they had to be said
hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Let us get things straightened out&mdash;before the
crowd messes in," I said. "Three years ago we
were engaged to be married. One day I was
obliged to tell your Aunt Mehitable that the comfortable
fortune my father had left me had been
swallowed up in an exhausted Colorado gold mine,
and that I'd have to go to work for a living. She
then told me&mdash;with what seemed to me to be
unnecessary spitefulness&mdash;that her will was made
in favor of some charitable institution, and since
you would thus be left penniless, it was up to me
to set you free and give you a chance to marry
somebody who could provide for you. Am I
stating it clearly?"</p>

<p>"Clearly enough."</p>

<p>"Then she went on to say that the news of my
misfortune had preceded me; that you had already
been told all there was to tell; and that it would
be a kindness to you if I should agree not to see
you again."</p>

<p>"And you did me the kindness," she put in
calmly. "I ought to be thankful for that. Perhaps
I am thankful."</p>

<p>"I was furious," I confessed. "If you will
permit me to say it this long after the fact, your
aunt carries a vicious tongue in her head, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
didn't spare me. Also, I'll admit that my own
temper isn't exactly patient or forgiving. It was
the next morning that I had the chance to go to
South America thrust at me, and the ship was
sailing at noon. I left a letter for you and disappeared
over the horizon."</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied in the same even tone; "I
got the letter."</p>

<p>"That brings us down to date," I went on, as
the taxi drew up at the wharf. "The next thing
is the <i>modus vivendi</i>&mdash;the way we must live for
the next few weeks. You say that Jerry knows
that we were once engaged. If he is half a man,
there will be plenty of chances for misunderstanding
and trouble. We must agree to be decently quarrelsome."</p>

<p>"You have begun it beautifully," she said, with
a hard little laugh. "Admitting your premises,
what will Jerry think of this taxi drive&mdash;without a
chaperon?"</p>

<p>"Jerry will never know that you came over with
me&mdash;unless you tell him."</p>

<p>"Aunt Mehitable can tell him," she retorted,
again with the touch of malice in her voice.</p>

<p>"But, for the sake of Major Terwilliger's money,
she won't tell him," I ventured drily; and a moment
later I was handing her up the <i>Andromeda's</i> accommodation
ladder with a sharper misery in my heart
than I had suffered since the night three years in
the past when her dragoness aunt had goaded me
into effacing myself.</p>

<p>There was a pleasant bustle of impending departure
already going on aboard the yacht when
we reached the deck. Most of the women&mdash;all of
them, in fact, save the youngest of the Van Tromp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
trio and Annette Grey&mdash;had gone to their several
staterooms, and the men were scattered&mdash;"dotted"
was Conetta's word&mdash;here and there, apparently
trying to find themselves, like so many cats in a
strange garret.</p>

<p>"You will go below?" I said to Conetta when I
had shown her the way aft.</p>

<p>"Yes; and by myself, if you please." Then,
with a quick turn of the proud little head, and a
look in the slate-blue eyes that was far beyond any
man's fathoming: "Good-night, Dick, and good-by.
Perhaps our quarrel would better begin right here
and now." And with that she was gone.</p>

<p>It was possibly five minutes later that I met
Grey, the newly married, roving in search of his
mate.</p>

<p>"Annette?" he queried. "Have you seen her
anywhere, Preble?"</p>

<p>"She is with Edie Van Tromp on the bridge,"
I told him. Then I linked an arm in his and
drew him to the shoreward rail, saying: "Don't
rush off. Throw that vile cigar away and light a
fresh one, and tell me how the New York law
partnership is getting along. Remember, there are
some weeks ahead of you in which you won't be
able to get any farther away from Annette than the
length of the <i>Andromeda</i>&mdash;no matter how badly
you may want to."</p>

<p>The married lover twisted his arm out of mine
and dropped the stub of his cigar over the rail.</p>

<p>"Preble, you're a brute," he remarked, quite
conversationally. And then he added: "By Jove,
don't you know, I wouldn't be a bachelor again for
the shiniest million that was ever minted! I
didn't realize, until within the last few weeks, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
a crabbed, dog-in-the-manger beggar it would
make of a man."</p>

<p>"Thanks," I laughed. "Experience counts for
something, even if it is short and pretty recent,
as you might say. Where is the major?"</p>

<p>Grey clipped the end of the fresh cigar I had
given him and lighted it. He was sparing me a
few moments merely to show me that it was possible
for him to stay that long out of sight and sound of
the loved one.</p>

<p>"The major is in a class by himself, as you ought
to know if you've preserved any fragment of
memory, Preble. He is down in the yacht's smoking-room,
hobnobbing with a glass of hot brandy
and soda, and finishing a novel that he has been
reading all the way down from Chattanooga. Think
of it&mdash;hot toddy in this weather!"</p>

<p>"A veteran&mdash;even a Spanish War Veteran&mdash;has
to do something to individualize himself," I jested;
and then Grey took his turn at me.</p>

<p>"You are a veteran yourself, Richard&mdash;of a sort.
They tell me you have been knocking around here
in the tropics so long that you've forgotten all the
little decent and civilized ameliorations. Why
don't you marry and settle down?"</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"Go up yonder on the bridge and ask Annette
why some men marry and some don't; she'll tell
you," I said; and he promptly took me at my word,
at least so far as leaving me was concerned.</p>

<p>A short time after this, just after I had identified
the two smokers in the wicker lounging chairs under
the afterdeck awning as Ingerson and Madeleine
Barclay's father, the last truck-load of trunks
came. While the baggage was going into the <i>Andromeda's</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
forehold, Dupuyster, looking more English
than any Briton to the manner born, came lounging
aft and greeted me chirpingly.</p>

<p>"'Lo, old chappie; dashed glad to know you're
comin' along, what? Bonty was just tellin' me
he'd scragged you for the voyage. Topping, I'll
say."</p>

<p>"Topping, if you say so, Jerry. How long have
you been over?"</p>

<p>"Eh, what?&mdash;how long have I been over? I say,
old dear&mdash;that's a jolly good one, y' know. But
tell me; where is this bally old tub of Bonty's
goin' to sail for? Bonty won't tell us. He's as
mysterious about it as&mdash;as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Realizing that he was feeling around in his
ultra-British vocabulary for a fitting Anglo-maniacal
simile, I helped him out.</p>

<p>"As a bag of tricks, let us say. I don't know,
any more than you do, Jerry. Summer seas in
midwinter, and all that, I suppose. What do we
care?"</p>

<p>"Haw! dashed little, so long as the <i>Andromeda's</i>
well found in the provision lockers: eh? what?
And Bonty will have seen to that." Then: "I've
been lookin' about a bit for Conetta. Did she come
aboard with you?"</p>

<p>I nodded. "She has gone to her stateroom, I
believe."</p>

<p>The young man whose chief end in life seemed to
be to out-English the English lighted a cigarette
and lounged on farther aft. I followed the movements
of his white-flanneled figure with the gaze
speculative. Quite as truly as in the case of
Bonteck Van Dyck&mdash;though in a vastly different
manner&mdash;here was a "perfectly good cat, spoiled."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
I had known Jerry Dupuyster quite intimately in
the university days; known him for a lovable
fellow with rather more, than less, than his fair
allowance of brains and ability. But something,
either the bait of the major's hypothetical fortune,
or too much idleness&mdash;or both&mdash;had turned him
into .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the speculative train paused. I didn't
know what the compelling influences had turned
Jerry Dupuyster into, but whatever it might be,
it seemed too trivial to warrant the effort needful
to try to define it.</p>

<p>Sauntering forward on the starboard promenade
I saw that Grey had joined his wife and Edie Van
Tromp on the bridge, and that Van Dyck and a
lean, hatchet-faced man whom I took to be the
yacht's sailing-master, were with them. While I
looked on, Goff, the sailing-master, came down to
the rail to direct the stowing of the last load of
luggage through the open port below. Like some
other things in this Caribbean cruise entourage, this
man Goff was a new wrinkle, and a rather astounding
one. Hitherto&mdash;at least in my knowing of
them&mdash;the <i>Andromeda's</i> skippers had been of the
Atlantic-liner class, spick and span martinets in
natty uniform, with fine, quarter-deck manners, and
maintaining a discipline comparable only to that
of the Navy.</p>

<p>But Goff was at the other end of the gamut of
extremes; a gaunt, hard-bitted old Yankee fishing-smack
captain, if appearances counted for anything;
hungry-looking, lank and weather-beaten, with a
harsh voice and a bad eye. And to emphasize the
oddities, the sailormen he was directing seemed to
be all foreigners; another sea change sharply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
opposed to Van Dyck's former notions about manning
his yacht.</p>

<p>As it appeared, there was to be no loss of time
in the outsetting. While the trunks were still
tumbling into the hold baggage-room, a subdued
clamor came up from the fire hold, and the yacht's
twin funnels began to echo to the roar of the stirred
fires. A minute later the lower-river pilot, a hairy-faced
giant who might have taken the heavy villain's
part in comic opera, climbed aboard. With
a bare nod to the sailing-master, the giant ascended
to the bridge, and almost immediately the yacht's
searchlight blazed out, the order to cast off was
given, and the trim white hull, shuddering to the
thrust of its propellers, edged away into the brown
flood of the Mississippi, and made a majestic half-circle
in midstream to pass the lights of the city
in review as it was headed for the Gulf.</p>

<p>Dodging the pair of smokers under the after-deck
awning, I went around to the port promenade,
where I stumbled upon Billy Grisdale sitting alone
with his bull pup between his knees.</p>

<p>"Hello, Prebby," he said, much as if it had been
only three days instead of as many years since he
had come down to the East River pier, a fresh-faced
prep. school-boy, to see me off for the tropics.
"Come over here and sit down and give me a
smoke." And when I had done all three: "Rum
old go, isn't it? If I wasn't such an ass about
carrying a tune, I'd be warbling 'My native land,
good-night.' Got your life insured?"</p>

<p>"I'm an orphan and a bachelor; why should I
carry insurance, Billy?" I said, laughing at his
doleful humor.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Guess I've got a bad case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the hyps. Can't think of anything but that bloody-bones
jingle of Stevenson's:</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Fifteen men on a dead man's chest,<br />
Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum!'<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Teck Van Dyck's a pirate. He's gone daffy over
something, and we're all going to heaven in a
hand-basket."</div>

<p>Of course this was all froth; pure froth. But
there was usually a little clear liquor in the bottom
of Billy's stein.</p>

<p>"What ails you?" I asked.</p>

<p>An impish grin spread itself over his smooth,
boyish face.</p>

<p>"I'm in love, if anybody should ask you. Everything
looks green to me, and I want to chew slate-pencils.
<i>Ergo</i>&mdash;which is college slang for 'Ah,
there, stay there'&mdash;I'm as daffy as Teck. Don't
laugh or I'll set Tige on you. Say, Prebby, do I
look like an invalid?"</p>

<p>"Yes; about as much as Mr. John Sullivan did
when he carried the world heavy-weight wallop in
his good right hand."</p>

<p>"Yet I am an invalid. Doc Fanning says I am,
and he's like George Washington. He might lie if
he could, but he can't because he's lost the combination."</p>

<p>"What on earth are you gibbering about, Billy?"</p>

<p>"Facts; iron-clad, brass-bound, blown-in-the-bottle,
sold-only-in-the-original-package facts.
Fanning's the family physician, you know, and he
has gone on record as declaring that I need half
a winter off in a mild climate. And I don't know
to this good minute whether I succeeded in fooling
him, or whether he was just plain good-natured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
enough to size the thing up and fool the governor&mdash;I
don't, really, Prebby."</p>

<p>"But why?" I persisted.</p>

<p>"The 'why' is a girl, of course; you ought to
know that without being told. She's a lulu and a
charmer, and if I can't marry her I'll end it all
with a bare bodkin. Her name? I'm going to
tell you, Prebby; and, again, if you laugh, I'll
make Tige bite you. It's Edith."</p>

<p>"Not Edie Van Tromp!"</p>

<p>"Prebby, you're the one only and original wizard.
You could make your fortune if you should
set up as a guesser."</p>

<p>"Ye gods and little children!" I commented.
"Edie Van Tromp is eighteen, if I remember correctly;
and you are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was twenty a few days ago, if you don't
mind," he returned, tickling the cropped ears of
the bull pup. And then: "'Crazy,' you say?
Maybe so&mdash;quite likely so. I've got to keep the
pace, you know. This little ship's full of crazy
people. I'm crazy about Edie, and, if you listen
to what you hear, Jerry Dupuyster's crazy about
Conetta Kincaide&mdash;just like you used to be&mdash;and
Jack Grey's crazy about his Annette, and Ingerson
and Teck are both crazy about Madeleine Barclay.
So there you are. And if the wind gets around
into the sour east, Teck's going to sink the ship in
the deep-blue Caribbean, and drown us all&mdash;all
but Madeleine&mdash;and live happily ever after. Apropos
of nothing at all, Prebby, this is a rotten cigar
you gave me, and I'm all mussed up and discouraged.
What's that bell clanging about?"</p>

<p>"It is striking five bells in the first night watch&mdash;otherwise,
or landsman-wise, half-past ten o'clock."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good!&mdash;excellent good. Let's turn in, so we
can turn out bright and early for our first shot at
the blue water. What do you say?"</p>

<p>I said the required word, and we went below to
our respective staterooms. The next morning when
I turned out and drew aside the curtain shading
the stateroom port light, the sun was shining
brightly, and for a horizon there were only the
tumbling wavelets of the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<h2>III<br />
<br />
<small>THE MAJOR&mdash;AND OTHERS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first morning in blue water developed the
fact that breakfast on the <i>Andromeda</i> was destined
to be a broken meal. In the white-lacquered dining-saloon,
only three members of the ship's company,
Major Terwilliger, Madeleine Barclay's father, and
Professor Sanford were at table, though Van Dyck
and Billy Grisdale had been still earlier, had already
breakfasted and had gone on deck.</p>

<p>As I took my place, the major, affecting the bluff
heartiness which was merely a mask for an ease-loving,
self-centered habit which never for a
moment lost sight of the creature comforts, was
trying, quite ineffectually, to draw Sanford into a
discussion of the merits and demerits of certain
French liqueurs&mdash;a subject upon which the clean-living,
abstemious professor of mathematics was
as poorly informed as any anchorite of the desert.</p>

<p>"Vermuth, now; a dash of vermuth in your
morning bitters," the major expatiated; "there's
nothing like it for an appetiser. I'm not saying
anything against the modern cocktail, properly
compounded; it has its place. But for a morning
eye-opener it is crude. Believe me, a Frenchman
knows the meaning of the word <i>apéritif</i> much better
than we do."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said the professor, with a palpable
effort to galvanize an interest which he was evidently
far from feeling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quite so," declared the major; after which he
proceeded to enlarge upon American backwardness
in the matter of picking and choosing among the
potables, inveighing with all the warmth of a past
master in the art of good living against the barbarism
of taking one's liquor raw.</p>

<p>While the major was giving his alcoholic homily,
and not omitting, meanwhile, to keep his plate
well supplied with the crispest bits of bacon and the
hottest of the rolls, I had an opportunity to observe
the silent man whose place was opposite my own.
Holly Barclay had changed greatly in the three
years which had elapsed since I had last seen him
in New York. I never knew&mdash;I do not yet know&mdash;what
particular form his dissipation took, but it had
left its indubitable record in the haggard face, the
deep-sunken eyes, and in the womanish hands which
trembled a bit in spite of an evident effort to hold
them steady.</p>

<p>Fragmentary gossip of former days had said that
Holly Barclay's bane was women; other whispers
had it that it was the gaming table; still others
that it was the larger gaming table of the Street.
Whatever it was, it had apparently left him a
rather ghastly wreck of a man; a prey, not to
remorse, perhaps, but certainly to fear. And with
the fear in the deep-set eyes there was a hint of
childish petulance; the irritable humor of a man
who has fought a losing battle with life and expects
to be waited upon and coddled as a reward for his
defeat and humiliation.</p>

<p>It was a relief to turn from this haggard wreck,
and from the sham-hearty major, to the mild-eyed
professor. Sanford I had known in the university,
and a less self-conscious or more lovable man never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
lived. Deeply immersed in the natural sciences,
which were his hobby, and absent-minded at times
to a degree that put to shame the best efforts of
the college-professor-joke makers, he was nevertheless
the most human of men; a faculty member
whose door was always hospitably open to the
homesick Freshman, and whose influence for good
in the lush field of the college campus was second
only to that of his plain-featured, motherly wife.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," he was saying, in answer to the major's
eulogy of chartreuse as a cordial, "it is said to be
a distillation from the leaves of <i>Urtica pilulifera</i>,
the much-abused nettle, I believe. Those old
Alpine monks had a wonderful knowledge of the
scanty flora of the high altitudes where they built
their monasteries. Which reminds me: I hope
Bonteck will give us an opportunity to study some
of the remarkable plant forms peculiar to the
tropics before we return. It would be most enlightening
to a stay-at-home like myself."</p>

<p>The major's facial expression was that of a person
who has been basely betrayed into casting pearls
before swine. That any one could be so benighted
as to associate a divine cordial only with the
crude materials out of which it might be made was
quite beyond his powers of comprehension.</p>

<p>"Hum," he muttered, "I've always understood
that the process of chartreuse-making was a secret
that was most jealously guarded." And with that
he let the pearl casting stop abruptly.</p>

<p>Here was a striking example, one would say, of
the ill-assortment of our mixed ship's company
manifesting itself at the introductory breakfast at
sea. Throughout the meal Barclay said nothing to
any of us. His few remarks were addressed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
serving steward, and they were all in the nature of
complaints. His coffee was too weak, the bacon
was too crisp, the cold meats were underdone.
What with the gourmet appetite of the major, and
Barclay's apparent lack of any appetite at all, the
broken meal was anything but a feast of reason
and a flow of soul, and I was glad to break away to
the freedom of the decks.</p>

<p>Finding the after-deck untenanted, I strolled
forward. The <i>Andromeda</i> was loafing along over a
sea as calm as a mill-pond, and her course, as nearly
as I could guess it from the position of the sun, was
a little to the east of south. Van Dyck and Billy
Grisdale were on the bridge, and one of the foreign-looking
sailormen had the wheel. On the main-deck
forward three members of the crew were swabbing
down, and two others were polishing brass. As I
paused at the rail in the shadow of the bridge overhang,
Goff, the sailing-master, came stumping
along. Though no one had as yet told me that he
was a Gloucesterman, I took a shot at it.</p>

<p>"This is not much like cracking on with a
schooner for the Banks, is it, Captain?" was the
form the shot took; and the grizzled veteran of the
sea stopped and looked me over with an eye
militantly appraisive.</p>

<p>"What you know about the Banks?" he inquired
hostilely.</p>

<p>"Little enough," I admitted. "One trip, made
when I was a boy, in the schooner <i>Maria Ann</i>, of
Gloucester, Captain Standifer."</p>

<p>"I want to know!" he said, thawing perceptibly.
"Old <i>Maria Ann's</i> afloat yit, but Standifer's gone;
run down in a dory in a fog." Then, lowering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
his voice: "You don't belong to this New York
clanjamfry, do ye?"</p>

<p>"Not strictly speaking; I signed on in New
Orleans."</p>

<p>"Know these waters putty middlin' well?"</p>

<p>"I've sailed them a few times."</p>

<p>"Friend o' Cap'n Van Dyck's, I cal'late?"</p>

<p>"As good a friend as he has on earth, I hope."</p>

<p>At this the old sea dog thrust an arm in mine
and led me aft until we were out of earshot from
the bridge.</p>

<p>"What d' ye know about this here winter cruise?"
He fired the question at me belligerently.</p>

<p>"About its course and destination? Little or
much, as you choose to put it. What should I
know?"</p>

<p>He paid no attention to my question.</p>

<p>"Cap'n Van Dyck's all right, only he's too dum
hardheaded," he confided. "Picked up his 'tween-decks
lackeys in New York an' Havana. Don't
like the looks o' some on 'em. If you're a friend of
the Cap'n's, you keep a weather eye on that slick
lookin' yaller boy that waits on table in the dinin'-saloon."</p>

<p>"How am I to keep an eye on him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"When you're eatin' with the folks, you keep
'em from talkin' about things that yaller boy hadn't
ought to hear," he bit out, and with that he left me.</p>

<p>Here was a little mystery on our first day at sea.
What was it, in particular, that the mulatto serving
boy shouldn't hear? My mind went back to the
talk of the previous evening, across the table in
the dining-room of the New Orleans hotel. Now
that I came to analyze it, I realized that it had been
only cursorily explanatory on Van Dyck's part.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
While he seemed at the time to be perfectly frank
with me, it occurred to me now that I had all along
been conscious of certain reservations. A winter
cruise in the Caribbean; for the ship's company
a gathering of people whom he had threatened to
know better before the cruise ended; these were
about the only definite objects he had set forth.</p>

<p>But two things were pretty plainly evident.
Goff was deeper in Van Dyck's confidence than
I was; and, beyond this, the sailing-master was
making the mistake of thinking that I knew as
much as he did. It was no great matter, I
thought. If the mulatto under-steward needed
watching, I'd watch him, trusting to the future
to reveal the reason&mdash;if any there were&mdash;why he
should be watched.</p>

<p>Making my way to the awning-sheltered after-deck
lounge, which was still untenanted, I picked
out the easiest of the wicker chairs and sat down
to fill my pipe for an after-breakfast smoke. Before
the pipe had burned out, Ingerson put in his
appearance, lighting a black cigar as he came up
the cabin stair. If I had been free to select, he was
the last man in our curious assortment whom I
should have chosen as a tobacco companion, but
short of a pointed retreat to some other part of
the ship, there was no escape.</p>

<p>"Hello, Preble," he grunted, casting his gross
body into a chair. "Monopolizing the view, are
you? Seen anything of Madeleine?"</p>

<p>"Miss Barclay hadn't appeared when I breakfasted,"
I returned; and if I bore down a bit hard
on the courtesy prefix it was because I hated to
hear Madeleine's Christian name come so glibly
off his tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"How many days of this are we in for?" was
his next attempt.</p>

<p>"That, I suppose, will be left to the wishes of the
ship's company."</p>

<p>"All right," he grinned; "I guess I can stand it
as long as Van Dyck can."</p>

<p>I stole a glance aside at his heavy featured, half-bestial
face. It was the face of a man prematurely
aged, or aging, by the simple process of giving free
rein to his passions and appetites. Though he
couldn't have been more than thirty-two or three,
the telltale pouches were already forming under
the bibulous eyes. Though I suppose he was fresh
from his morning bath, I fancied I could detect the
aroma of many and prolonged midnight carousals
about him. Van Dyck's intimation that there was
even a possibility of Madeleine Barclay's throwing
herself away upon this gross piece of flesh came
back to me with a tingling shock of repugnance.
Surely she would never do such a thing of her own
free will.</p>

<p>We had been sitting in uncomradely silence for
maybe five minutes when Mrs. Van Tromp, mother
of marriageable, and as yet unmarried, daughters
came waddling aft to join us. How far she might
go in letting Ingerson's wealth atone for his many
sins, I neither knew nor cared, but that the wealth
had its due and proper weight with her was proved
by the alacrity with which she relieved me of the
necessity of taking any part in a three-cornered talk.
So, when I got up to empty my pipe ashes over the
rail, I kept on going, quite willingly abandoning
the field to inherited money and its avid worshiper.</p>

<p>With such an unfruitful beginning, one might
predicate an introductory day little less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
stupefying. But later on there were ameliorations.
After luncheon, which, like the breakfast, was a
straggling meal with only three or four of us at
table at the same time, I found myself lounging on
the port promenade with Beatrice, the middle
member of the Van Tromp trio, a fair-haired, self-contained
young woman with a slant toward bookish
things which set her well apart from her athletic
older sister and tomboyish younger.</p>

<p>"'Westward Ho!'?" I said, glancing at the title
of the book lying in her lap.</p>

<p>"Yes; I've been trying to get the atmosphere.
But Kingsley takes too much time with his introductions.
Whereabouts are we now?"</p>

<p>I marked the slow rise and fall of the ship as it
swung along making its leisurely southing. As in
the early morning, the <i>Andromeda</i> was logging only
loafing speed.</p>

<p>"We are still a long way from the scene of Sir
Francis Drake's more or less piratical exploits," I
told her. "Do you take Kingsley at his face
value?"</p>

<p>"He calls it war, but it seems to me more like
legalized buccaneering," she rejoined. Then: "How
much of it do you suppose is true?"</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>"Have you already learned to distrust history,
at your tender age?" I mocked. "Isn't it all set
down in the books?"</p>

<p>She turned large and disparaging eyes upon me.</p>

<p>"Of course you know well enough that all history
is distorted; especially war history where the victors
are the only source of information. The other
people can't tell their side of it."</p>

<p>"True enough," I admitted. "I fancy old Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Francis was a good bit more than half a pirate, if
all the facts were known. That story about his
burning of the Spanish galleon at Pirates' Hope,
for example."</p>

<p>"I haven't heard it. Tell it to me," she urged.</p>

<p>I gave her the story as Van Dyck had given it
to me, omitting&mdash;for no good reason that I could
have offered&mdash;all mention of my own unnerving
experiences on the island of the legend.</p>

<p>"Left those poor wretches to starve because they
wouldn't buy their lives off him?" she commented,
with a belated horror in her voice.</p>

<p>"It is only a legend, you must remember," I
hastened to say. "Most likely there isn't a word
of truth in it."</p>

<p>Her gaze was upon the distant merging line of
sea and sky, and there was a dreamy look in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"I should like to see that island," she said. "I
wonder if we shall go anywhere near it?"</p>

<p>If I smiled it was only at the hold the ancient
tale had apparently taken upon her.</p>

<p>"Bonteck will doubtless make it a port of call,
if you ask him to. But it is hundreds of miles
from here."</p>

<p>"What does it look like?"</p>

<p>"Very much like any or all of the coral islands
you may have seen pictured in your school geographies,
only it is long and narrow instead of being
circular, like the Pacific atolls. But it is a true
coral island, for all that; a strip of land possibly
a quarter of a mile wide and a mile long, densely
wooded&mdash;jungled, you might say&mdash;with tropical
vegetation; a beach of white sand running all the
way around; beyond the beach, a lagoon; and enclosing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the lagoon, and with only a few passages
through it here and there, the usual coral reef.
The lagoon is shallow for the greater part of it, but
outside of the reef the bottom goes down like the
side of a mountain."</p>

<p>"Why, you must have seen the island!" she said.</p>

<p>"I have," I answered, rather grimly.</p>

<p>"Did you land on it when you were there?&mdash;but
of course you must have, to be able to describe it
so well."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I landed upon it," I admitted.</p>

<p>Again she let her gaze go adrift to leeward. She
was evidently reveling in something that seemed to
her more tangible than Kingsley's famous story of
Amyas Leigh and his voyagings.</p>

<p>"You say it is called Pirates' Hope. Was that
on account of Sir Francis Drake's battle with the
Spanish galleon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I imagine it got its name at a much
later date; in the time of the bold buccaneers.
There are two little bays, one on the north and
another on the south. Either would be a good
place in which to careen the little cockleshell ships
of our ancestors and scrape their bottoms. Possibly
Morgan or some of the others put in there for
that purpose and thus gave the island its name."</p>

<p>"Did you find any relics when you were there?"</p>

<p>It didn't seem necessary to tell this open-minded
young woman about the bones, so I turned her
question aside.</p>

<p>"The last of the buccaneers was permanently
hanged some time in the closing decade of the
seventeenth century, if I remember rightly. You'd
scarcely expect to find any traces of them or their
works now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; that's so," she conceded.</p>

<p>Into the pause that followed I thrust a query of
my own.</p>

<p>"Where has Conetta been keeping herself all
day?"</p>

<p>"She is with her aunt. It seems that Miss Gilmore
isn't a very good sailor."</p>

<p>I laughed because I couldn't help it. If the
dragoness was upset by the easy swinging of the
<i>Andromeda</i> over a sea that was more like a gently
undulating mirror than anything else, what would
happen to her if we should encounter a gale, or
even half a gale?</p>

<p>"You needn't laugh," Beatrice put in reproachfully.
"There is nothing funny about seasickness."</p>

<p>"I was laughing at the idea of anybody's being
seasick in weather like the present," I explained.
"But I fancy it is the old story in the case of
Miss Mehitable. If she had nothing worse than
a toothache, Conetta would have to play the part
of a nurse."</p>

<p>"My-oh!" said my pretty lounging-companion;
"it is perfectly easy to see that there is no love
lost between you and Miss Mehitable."</p>

<p>"There isn't," I replied shortly; and there that
matter rested.</p>

<p>Still later in the day&mdash;just at sunset, to be
strictly accurate as to the time&mdash;there was another
compensation for a day which had been hanging
rather heavily on my hands. I had gone alone
into the yacht's fore-peak, and was wondering if I
should have time to smoke another pipe before the
dinner call should sound, when a mocking voice
behind me said: "Isn't it about time we were
quarreling some more?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>I went on filling my pipe without looking around.</p>

<p>"You've been careful not to give me an earlier
chance," I said. "How is your Aunt Mehitable
by this time?"</p>

<p>"She is able to sit up and take a bit of nourishment."
Then: "How you do hate poor Aunt Mehitable,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"As I see it, I haven't any particularly good
reason to squander any part of my scanty store of
affection upon her. Did she know I was going to
make one of this mixed-up ship's-quota?"</p>

<p>"Honestly, I don't think she did. She said a
tremendous lot of things last night when she saw
you with Bonteck. Aren't you going to be decent
to her?"</p>

<p>"She is Bonteck's guest, or one of them, and I'm
another. South America and the tropics haven't
sacked me of quite all of the conventionalities."</p>

<p>"How nice! Of course, we've all been supposing
they had. When are you going to tell me some
more about the Castilian princess? the one you
could have married, and didn't&mdash;to your later
sorrow."</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, all this light-hearted
mockery cut into me much more deeply than any
real bitterness could have. Because, let me explain,
it was precisely the attitude she used to
hold toward me in the old days when the mockeries
were only so many love taps, as one might say; a
sort of joyous letting down, or keying up, for her,
after a day-long immurement with a crotchety,
sharp-tongued maiden aunt.</p>

<p>"I've told you all there is to tell," I said, as
gruffly as I could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no; I'm sure you haven't. Was she&mdash;is
she&mdash;very beautiful? But of course she must
be; luminous dark eyes burning with&mdash;er&mdash;with all
sorts of things; midnight hair; an olive skin so
clear and transparent that you can almost see
through it; little aristocratic hands&mdash;blue-blooded
hands; and a figure .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tell me, is she large and
queenly? or petite and child-like?"</p>

<p>I laughed derisively.</p>

<p>"You seem to have forgotten that not all Spaniards
are black. There are some among them as
fair as you are. The 'princess,' as you call her,
has hair about the color of yours, and her eyes are
blue, even bluer than yours. But I don't see
what interest you can have in her. I didn't marry
her."</p>

<p>"But you may go back there&mdash;wherever it is&mdash;and
correct that dreadful mistake."</p>

<p>"In that case I should first be obliged to murder
her present husband. Perhaps I omitted to tell
you last night that she was very successfully married
to a wealthy young coffee planter, just before
I left Trujillo."</p>

<p>"Well, you wouldn't let a little thing like that
stop you if you wanted to go back, would you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; certainly not. Don Jesus Maria Diego
de Traviano would probably do the stopping act&mdash;with
a soft-nosed bullet. He is a crack shot with
a Mauser, as I happen to know."</p>

<p>"Poor you!" she murmured. Then, with the
lightning-like change of front which had been one
of her chief attractions&mdash;for me&mdash;in the old days:
"Why don't you quarrel?&mdash;say something that I'll
have to get mad and bitter at?"</p>

<p>I turned to face her and the sheer beauty of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
shook me. Yet I did contrive to strike back, after
a fashion.</p>

<p>"The voyage is yet young. There will doubtless
be many quarrelsome occasions. Just now I
don't think of anything more vital than this: if
you are meaning to keep Jerry Dupuyster in hand,
you are going the wrong way about it. If you
seem to prefer my company to his, I have an idea
that he would be just Quixotic enough to let you
have your own way."</p>

<p>"Thanks, awfully," she laughed, but behind the
laugh the slate-blue eyes were saying things out of
a very different vocabulary. "That will do very
nicely for a beginning. I suppose I shall have to
give Jerry a few lessons in the proper reactions.
Isn't that the tinkle-tinkle of the dinner gong?"</p>

<p>It was; and a few minutes later our ship's company,
lacking only Miss Mehitable, who was still
confined to her stateroom, gathered for the first
time as a whole around the long table in the dining-saloon
of the <i>Andromeda</i>. And in the seating I
took blessed good care to have Beatrice Van Tromp
on my left and motherly Mrs. Sanford for a bulwark
on my right.</p>

<h2>IV<br />
<br />
<small>THE LOG OF THE ANDROMEDA</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the first few days of our southward
voyaging the routine on board fell easily into the
rut predicted by Van Dyck in the talk across the
dinner-table in the New Orleans hotel; three meals
a day, a good bit of more or less listless lounging
under the awnings between times, and rather half-hearted
battles with the cards in the evenings.</p>

<p>Day after day we had the same cloudless skies,
and the same gentle breeze quartering over the
port bow; and each morning there was apparently
the same school of porpoises tumbling in the swell
under the yacht's forefoot. Marking the course,
I saw little change in it from day to day. We were
still steering either south or a few points east of
south, and if Van Dyck had any intention of touching
at any of the Central American ports, the telltale
compass in the ceiling of the dining-saloon did
not indicate it.</p>

<p>Of the growth of Bonteck's cynical scheme of
human analysis there were as yet no signs visible
to the casual bystander. Mrs. Eager Van Tromp
and Conetta's dragoness aunt sat in the shade of
the after-deck awning, reading novels, and fanning
themselves in moments when the breeze failed; and
the Van Tromp trio, sometimes with Conetta and
Madeleine Barclay, and always with Billy Grisdale
and his bull pup, when they were not pointedly
driven away, roamed the ship from bow to stern,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and from bridge to engine-room. The Greys,
prolonging their honeymoon, hid themselves in
out-of-the way corners like a pair of lovers; and
the Sanfords, serenely enjoying their first real
vacation, could be stumbled upon now and then&mdash;so
Billy Grisdale averred&mdash;holding hands quite
like the younger pair.</p>

<p>As for the men, candor compels the admission
that the deadly blight of <i>ennui</i> seemed to be slowly
settling down upon at least four of us. Van Dyck,
though scrupulously careful of his responsibilities
as host, was anything but good company when he
was off duty. The major and Holly Barclay, with
Ingerson and anybody who could be dragooned
into taking a fourth hand, played cards hours on
end in the yacht's smoking-room; for nominal stakes,
John Grey hinted, when neither Ingerson nor Van
Dyck was sitting in, but with the sky for the limit
when either of the two really rich men was present
and betting.</p>

<p>The second time Grey mentioned this I thought
it might be well to dig a little deeper.</p>

<p>"You are Bonteck's guest, Jack, and so am I,"
I said bluntly. "Are you making charges?"</p>

<p>"Not me," returned the married lover, with a
lapse into prematrimonial carelessness of speech.
And then, after a reflective moment, "But for that
matter, I don't have to make them, Preble. Everybody
buys wisdom of the major now and then over
the card table. It has come to be a proverb, back
home. For a supposedly rich man he plays a
mighty thrifty game&mdash;and that remark is not
original with me, not by a long shot."</p>

<p>"Possibly the major is saving his money for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Gerald," I suggested, more to see what Grey
would say than for any other reason.</p>

<p>Grey's slow wink was more expressive than many
words.</p>

<p>"That worn-out joke doesn't fool you any more
than it does me," he asserted baldly. "You've
never seen Major Terwilliger in his great and unapproachable
act of coupon-clipping, have you?"</p>

<p>I was obliged to admit that I had not.</p>

<p>"Well, neither has anyone else, I venture to say.
He is a shrewd, shifty old rounder, Preble; no more
and no less. And there are men in New York
who will tell you that he sails pretty close to the
wind a good bit of the time&mdash;that he has to to save
his face. It's a nasty thing to say, but I more
than half believe he is playing Gerald up to Conetta
for purely fiduciary reasons."</p>

<p>"But Conetta has no money," I protested.</p>

<p>"No; but Aunt Mehitable has&mdash;a barrel of it.
And it will come to Conetta, sooner or later&mdash;always
provided Conetta marries to please Aunt Mehitable."</p>

<p>Now this statement was not exactly in accordance
with the facts, as I knew them, or thought I knew
them, and I said so.</p>

<p>"Miss Mehitable's will is already made, and I
happen to know that her money will not go to
Conetta. It will be divided among a number of
charitable institutions."</p>

<p>We were on the starboard promenade forward,
and Grey looked around as if to make sure there
were no overhearers.</p>

<p>"I'm going to breach a professional confidence
and tell you something, Preble, taking it for granted
that it will go no farther. One day about three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
years ago, while I was reading for my Bar examinations
in the office of Maxim, Townsend and Maxim,
Miss Mehitable did make just such a will as you
mention; I know it because I made the transcript
of it. That will was left in the office safe, and something
like a week later she came back, asked for
it, got it, and destroyed it. Then she had Townsend
draw another&mdash;which I also copied. That
one, so far as I know, is still in existence and unchanged.
It leaves a few bequests to the charity
folk, and the bulk of the property to Conetta."</p>

<p>If Grey had drawn off and hit me in the face I
could scarcely have been more dumfounded. For
some inscrutable&mdash;and wicked&mdash;reason of her own,
Aunt Mehitable had wanted to break our engagement,
Conetta's and mine, and the loss of my
patrimony had given her an easy half of the
means. Upon hearing of my loss she had quickly
supplied the other half by making the will which
she didn't mean to let stand&mdash;which she had
promptly destroyed as soon as I had been safely
eliminated. The grim irony of her expedient might
have been amusing if I hadn't been so angry. She
might easily have lied to me about the disposition
of her property, but that would have been against
her principles. To quiet what she was probably
calling her conscience, she had actually made the
will with which she had clubbed me to death; a
will which she fully intended to revoke, and did
revoke&mdash;after I was out of the way.</p>

<p>How much or how little Grey suspected the turmoil
he had stirred up in me by his breach of office
confidence I do not know, but he was good enough
to give me a chance to get back to normal, searching
his pockets for a cigar, and, when he had found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
one, turning his back to me&mdash;and the breeze&mdash;while
he lighted it.</p>

<p>"Do you think Miss Gilmore believes in the
major's coupon clipping?" I asked, after I had
contrived to swallow the shock he had given me.</p>

<p>Again he let me see the slow wink.</p>

<p>"That is the farcical part of it. For a sharp-eyed,
keen-witted maiden lady who has made a good bit
of real money buying and selling in the Street, it
is little less than wonderful. But it's a fact,
Preble; she <i>does</i> believe in it. She lets the major
write himself off at his own valuation, and never
dreams of asking to see a certified check. She
seems to regard Jerry Dupuyster as one of the few
really desirable matrimonial propositions on the
market. That is why she is here&mdash;with Conetta."</p>

<p>This last assertion of Grey's told me nothing that
I had not already set down as an obvious fact, but
his gossipy talk afforded a luminous commentary
upon the manner in which an isolated group of
human beings will secrete all sorts of small uncharities,
if the isolation be only complete enough.
These little incidents to the contrary notwithstanding,
however, I could not see that Van Dyck was
making much progress in his unmasking experiment.
Up to this time, and outwardly, at least,
we were still only a party of winter loiterers, pleasurers,
decently grateful to our host and decently
and conventionally well-behaved. If there were
any plots or conspiracies of the money-hunting
sort in the air, they were not suffered to become
unpleasantly obtrusive.</p>

<p>But for one member of the party I was conscious
of a great and growing contempt. In former days
we of the younger set had known Holly Barclay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
as a sort of reincarnation of the Beau Brummell
type; an idler of the clubs who lived upon his
wife's money, and who was much too indolent
to be even manfully vicious. Good-looking, in a
way, self-centered, and even more finically careful
for the creature comforts and luxuries than Major
Terwilliger, I remember it had seemed grossly
incredible to us younger folk that he could be
the father of the thoughtful, high-minded and
convincingly beautiful young woman who paid him
the compliment of being his daughter.</p>

<p>From the beginning of the voyage Barclay's
attitude had been sufficiently apparent to me, or
I thought it was. I decided that he was somewhat
anxiously weighing the pros and cons as between
Van Dyck and Ingerson in the matrimonial
scale; weighing them strictly with reference to
the results as they might affect him, individually,
and quite without concern for his daughter's future
happiness. That Bonteck was a clean man and a
gentleman, while his rival was everything that
Van Dyck was not, appeared to cut no figure.</p>

<p>It was hugely farcical, if one could but shut his
eyes to the possible tragedies involved. Holly
Barclay had joined the <i>Andromeda's</i> company to
dispose of his daughter. Ingerson had come as a
cold-blooded buyer to the market. Miss Mehitable
was hoping to corner the major and Gerald Dupuyster;
and Mrs. Van Tromp, yielding precedence, of
course, to Barclay and his schemings, had come on
the chance of dividing the spoils, since one of the
two chief matrimonial prizes would be left after
Madeleine&mdash;or rather Madeleine's father&mdash;had secured
the other.</p>

<p>That Mrs. Van Tromp's armament was only a
secondary battery might have been denied by some.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Alicia, the oldest of the trio, was, as I may have
said, an attractive young woman of the athletic
type, a rider to hounds, a champion swimmer, and
a good comrade where men were concerned. In the
modern meaning of the term she was a man's
woman, with a sort of compelling charm that was
all her own.</p>

<p>Beatrice, the second daughter, had, as has been
noted, a bookish turn. If she had chosen to study
surgery she would have been a ruthless vivisector.
As a result of this inquiring bent, she had an astonishing,
and sometimes rather disconcerting, knowledge
of things as they are. But to offset the touch
of the blue-stocking, she owned a pair of long-lashed
eyes that kindled quickly at any torch of
sentiment, and they were set in a face of uncommon
sweetness&mdash;winsomeness, one would say, if the
word were not so desperately outworn.</p>

<p>Edith, for whose sake Billy Grisdale was cutting
a good half of his Sophomore year, was a replica,
in rounder lines and easier curves, of her sister
Alicia. Having been carefully held back to give
her older sisters a clear field, she was still something
of a tomboy, but her very roughnesses were
lovable, and Billy's callow folly found, it must be
admitted, its full and sufficient excuse in its object.</p>

<p>It was Edie Van Tromp, roaming the yacht like
a restless bit of misdirected energy, as was her
custom, who came to fling herself into the steamer
chair next to mine; this in the afternoon of the
day when John Grey had given me still less cause
to love Miss Mehitable Gilmore.</p>

<p>"I'm bored, Mr. Richard Preble&mdash;bored to
extinction!" she gasped, fanning herself with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
vigor that was all her own. "Is nothing ever
going to happen on this tiresome ship?"</p>

<p>"There are things happening all the time, if
we only have eyes to perceive them," I told her,
laughing. "In your own case, for example, there is
Billy Grisdale. To an interested and sympathetic
onlooker like myself it would seem that he is constantly
happening in as many different ways as
he can devise."</p>

<p>"Oh, Billy&mdash;yes," she admitted, with pouting
emphasis. Then, with a great show of confidence:
"Uncle Dick&mdash;I may call you Uncle Dick, if I
want to, mayn't I?&mdash;if you were only a little older
and grayer I might tell you something."</p>

<p>"Tell me anyhow," I urged. "I am old enough
to be perfectly safe, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"It's Billy, and you started it," she went on
pertly. "That boy is fairly worrying the life out
of me. Positively, I'm getting the dreadful habit
of carrying my head on my shoulder. He&mdash;he's
always just there, you know, if I look around."</p>

<p>"Is that why you are bored?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it is; it must be. Nothing can ever
come of it, of course. Billy is nothing but just a
handsome, good-natured, sweet-tempered <i>boy</i>. It
would be years and years, and then more years
before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So it would," I agreed. "And, besides, Billy
has three brothers and two sisters coming along,
and Grisdale <i>père</i> is only moderately well-to-do,
as fortunes go nowadays."</p>

<p>Instantly Miss Edith's straight-browed eyes
flashed blue fire.</p>

<p>"Money&mdash;always and forever money!" she
flamed out. "I haven't heard anything else all my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
life! One would think that heaven itself was
paved with it and that the angels wear gold coins
for charmstrings. I <i>hate</i> it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you don't," I hastened to say. "It's
a good, broad-backed little beast, and you can
always count upon it for carrying the load. And
Billy will probably have to make his own way,
without even so much as a loan of the little beast."</p>

<p>"I don't care! I think it is perfectly frightful the
way we bow down and kowtow to your beast&mdash;the
great god Cash! I'd rather wash dishes and
make bread&mdash;for two!"</p>

<p>This seemed to be verging toward the edge of
things serious. I knew that Mrs. Van Tromp was
suffering Billy only because he was so absurdly
young as to be supposedly harmless. But if Edith,
the healthy-bodied and strong-willed, were even
beginning to take notice, there was trouble ahead.</p>

<p>"We can none of us afford to defy the conventions,
my dear girl," I cautioned, taking the avuncular
rôle she had tried to thrust upon me. "And
we mustn't let ourselves get into narrow little
ruts. The play's the thing, and we are only a part
of the audience&mdash;you and I."</p>

<p>"The play?" she echoed doubtfully. "You
mean the&mdash;the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean the great human comedy, of course. It
is going on all around us, all the time."</p>

<p>"I don't get you," she said, in the free phrase
which may have been her own, or may have been
a Billy Grisdale transplantation.</p>

<p>"You are too young and inexperienced," I
asserted in mock gravity. "Otherwise you could
hardly have lived a week in the <i>Andromeda</i> without
realizing that the stage is set, with the call-boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
making his last hasty round, beating upon the
doors of the dressing-rooms and summoning the
people of the play to come and take their places."</p>

<p>"I can't understand a word you say!" she protested
petulantly. "Do you mean Conetta and
Jerry Dupuyster?"</p>

<p>"Miss Kincaide and Jerry are only two, and the
cast of characters is large. Wait patiently, Edie,
and you shall see. Meanwhile, if I am not mistaken,
that long, low streak in the west&mdash;you can
just make it out if you shade your eyes from the
sun glare on the water&mdash;is land."</p>

<p>She was up and gone at the word, flying to the
bridge and crying her discovery&mdash;or mine. What
the land was, I could not tell. Van Dyck had
made a joking mystery of the yacht's course,
which, naturally, none of us could determine with
any degree of accuracy merely by looking now and
then at the telltale compass in the cabin ceiling. I
fancied that Van Dyck's object in keeping us in
the dark was chiefly to add something to the
zest of the cruise, the interest lying in the uncertainty
as to what landfall we should first make.
As to this, however, nobody seemed to care greatly
where we were going, or when we should arrive,
so, as one may say, the small mystery had hitherto
fallen flat.</p>

<p>But now there was a stir among the after-deck
idlers, and Major Terwilliger, thrifty grasper at
opportunity, immediately made a pool upon the
name of the landfall&mdash;with Jack Grey whispering
to me that the major had already fortified
himself by casually questioning the hard-faced
sailing-master as to the yacht's latest quadrant-reading&mdash;from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
which he had doubtless been able
privately to prick off the latitude and approximate
position of the <i>Andromeda</i> upon the cabin chart.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>




<h2>V<br />
<br />
<small>ANY PORT IN A STORM</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> an easy matter of course, Major Terwilliger
won the pool. The land sighted proved to be Cape
Gracias á Dios, the easternmost point of Nicaragua.
It would say itself that the Mosquito Coast, low,
swampy, and with only three practicable harbors
along its three-hundred-mile sweep, could have
no attractions for a party of winter pleasurers, and
we were leaving Cape Gracias astern when the
<i>Andromeda's</i> course was suddenly changed and she
was headed for land.</p>

<p>Climbing to the bridge a little later, where I
found Van Dyck setting the course for the Madeira-man
who had the wheel, I learned the reason for
the unannounced change.</p>

<p>"Trouble in the engine-room," Van Dyck explained.
"The port propeller shaft is running
hot and threatening to quit on us. We'll have to
lay up for a few hours until Haskell can find out
what has gone wrong."</p>

<p>"The shaft hasn't been giving any trouble heretofore,
has it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No; Haskell says it began to heat all at once,
shortly after we sighted land."</p>

<p>"You'll put in at Gracias?"</p>

<p>He nodded. "The harbor isn't much, and the
town is still less. But we don't need anything
but an anchorage. Haskell thinks we won't be
held up very long."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>That was a cheering prediction, but the event
proved it to be too optimistic. The mechanical
trouble turned out to be in the thrust bearing of
the propeller shaft, and it was more serious than
Haskell, chief of the engine-room squad, had supposed
it would be. The bearing which, like everything
else on the yacht, had been cared for with
warship thoroughness, had apparently run dry and
it was badly scored and "cut," as a machinist
would say. The repair called for hours of patient
scraping and filing, and Haskell, who had served
as an assistant engineer in the Navy, was properly
humiliated.</p>

<p>"It sure gets my goat, Mr. Preble," he confided
to me when I climbed down into his bailiwick some
three or four hours after we had dropped anchor
in Gracias á Dios harbor. "It looks as if it was
on me, and maybe it is, but I've never had anything
like this happen to me before&mdash;not since I
began as an oiler on one of the old Cunarders. We
have automatic lubrication; all the latest wrinkles;
and yet that cussed shaft's tore up like it had been
runnin' dry for a week. You're an engineer&mdash;I
just wish you'd look at it."</p>

<p>To oblige him I donned overalls and crawled
down into the shaft tunnel. A glance at the
excoriated bearing showed that Haskell hadn't
exaggerated. Quinby, Haskell's first assistant,
was scraping and smoothing in a space that was
too confined to let a man take the kinks out of
his back, and in which there was no room for two
men to work.</p>

<p>"That is no hurry job," I told Haskell, after I
had crawled out. "I think I may safely tell our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
people that they may have shore leave, if they
want it."</p>

<p>"You can that," Haskell grinned. "We'll be
right here to-morrow morning, and blamed lucky
if we can heave up the mud hook by some time
to-morrow afternoon."</p>

<p>It was too late to spread the news after I left
the engine-room. When I reached the main deck
all of our ship's company had apparently turned
in, though there were lights in the smoking-room
to hint that the card-players were still at their
favorite pastime. But as I went aft to smoke a
bed-time pipe I found Madeleine Barclay curled
up in one of the deep wicker chairs.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," I said; "I didn't know there
was any one here. Don't let me disturb your
maiden meditations. I'll vanish."</p>

<p>"You needn't," she returned quite amiably;
then, seeing the pipe: "And you may smoke if
you want to. You know well enough that I don't
mind. How long do we stay here?"</p>

<p>"That is upon the knees of the gods. I've just
been below, and I should say we are good for twenty-four
hours, or maybe more, though Haskell thinks
we may get out by to-morrow afternoon."</p>

<p>"Do we go ashore?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. "The others may if they
want to; I shan't."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"The <i>Andromeda</i> after-deck is much more comfortable
than anything to be found ashore in this
corner of Nicaragua."</p>

<p>"You have been here before?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I came around here once, something over
a year ago, on a steamer from Belize. We made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a stop of a few hours and I was besotted enough
to leave the ship. I shan't make any such mistake
again."</p>

<p>"Gracias á Dios," she said musingly. "I wonder
who said it first&mdash;and why he was thanking
God&mdash;particularly?"</p>

<p>I laughed. "Some storm-tossed mariner of the
early centuries, I imagine, who was glad enough
to make a landfall of any sort."</p>

<p>"Storm-tossed," she repeated. "Aren't we all
more or less storm-tossed, Richard?"</p>

<p>"I suppose we are, either mentally, morally, or
physically. It's a sad enough world, if you want
to take that angle."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to take that angle. When I
do take it, it's because I have to."</p>

<p>Being as much of a hypocrite as any of those
whom Van Dyck had proposed putting under his
analytical microscope, I said: "But there are no
constraining influences at work upon any of us
aboard this beautiful little pleasure ship&mdash;there
can't be."</p>

<p>"Do you think not?" she threw in; and then,
without warning: "How about you and Conetta,
Richard?"</p>

<p>In common justice to Conetta I had to feign an
indifference I was far from feeling&mdash;which was more
of the hypocrisy.</p>

<p>"That was all over and done with three years
ago, as you must know, Madeleine. She wasn't
aware of the fact that I was to be in the <i>Andromeda</i>
party; and I didn't know she was to be&mdash;at least,
not until after I had committed myself to Bonteck.
Of course we promptly quarreled the moment we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
met. Perhaps you may have noticed that we've
been quarreling ever since."</p>

<p>She smiled soberly.</p>

<p>"You have made it obvious&mdash;both of you; perhaps
a little too obvious." Then, after a momentary
silence: "Did Miss Mehitable give the real
reason for that other and mortal quarrel, three
years ago, Richard?"</p>

<p>"The reason she gave was enough, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Some of us thought it wasn't. I don't know
how you were acting, but Conetta didn't give a
very good imitation of a person who has 'agreed to
disagree.'"</p>

<p>"I can fill out the picture for you," I said grimly.
"I was acting like a man who had been fool enough
to lose his temper at the invitation of a crabbed
and rather spiteful person who was old enough to
be his mother."</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said; "I thought it was Miss Mehitable."
Then: "Was it because you had lost your
money?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, merely because the simple affirmative
seemed to afford the easiest way of brushing
aside explanations which might not explain.</p>

<p>It was then that Miss Madeleine Barclay became
a plagiarist, stealing the very words uttered
so hotly by Edie Van Tromp only a few hours
earlier.</p>

<p>"Money&mdash;always money! I <i>hate</i> it, Dick Preble!"</p>

<p>I did not answer her as I had answered Edith.</p>

<p>"It is a holy hatred, Madeleine. The love of
money, and what money will buy, has proved the
undoing of&mdash;but I don't need to preach to you.
Let's talk about something pleasant. Have you
ever seen a finer night than this?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"A fine night, and ideal conditions. In a way,
we've almost left the strugglesome, toiling, avariciously
dollar-chasing old world behind us, haven't
we?"</p>

<p>"You say 'almost'; why not quite?"</p>

<p>She made a little gesture inclusive of the <i>Andromeda</i>
as a whole.</p>

<p>"Too many reminders of the money and what
it will buy. We'd need to be shipwrecked upon
some uninhabited island to make the isolation perfect.
As that isn't going to happen, I think I'll
make the most of what we have and go to bed.
Good-night." And she left me.</p>

<p>My pipe had gone out and I refilled it. While
I had called the night fine, it was measurably
warm. With the yacht at anchor there was little
breeze, and what little there was came from sea.
My stateroom was on the port side, and as the
<i>Andromeda</i> was lying with that side toward the
land, I was reluctant to leave the open air for the
closer quarters between decks.</p>

<p>It was while I was smoking a second pipe in
comfortable solitude that I fell asleep. The lapse
into unconsciousness seemed only momentary, but
when I picked up the pipe which had fallen into
my lap there was no fire in it and the bowl had
grown cold. Also, in the interval, long or short,
the yacht's lights had been switched off and the
after-deck was shrouded in the soft darkness of the
tropical night. From somewhere in the under-depths
came a faint clatter of tools to tell me that
Haskell and his men were still at work on the
disabled shaft, but apart from this the silence was
unbroken.</p>

<p>Descending the cabin stair I groped my way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the door of my room, which was the farthest forward
on the port side, and I remembered afterward
that I thought it odd that the saloon lights were
all off. On all other occasions when I had been
up late I had found a single incandescent left on;
one, at least.</p>

<p>Inside of the luxurious little sleeping-room that
had been assigned to me I felt for the wall switch
and snapped it. Nothing happened. I snapped it
back and on again, and still nothing happened.
Down in the machinery hold I could hear the fluttering
murmur of the small auxiliary engine which
ran the lighting dynamo, and since it was running,
there seemed to be no reason why the lights
shouldn't come on. But they wouldn't.</p>

<p>While I was speculating upon this curious failure
of the lighting system and wondering if it were
worth while to go below to ask Haskell what was
the matter with the cabin circuit, sounds like the
subdued splashing of oars cautiously handled came
floating in through the open port. Since I judged
it must be midnight or worse, it was only natural
that I should want to know why a boat should be
coming off to the <i>Andromeda</i> after all the yacht's
people save myself were abed and asleep. Not
being able to see anything from the stateroom
port-light, I hurried back through the darkened
saloon and up to the deck. From the rail on the
shoreward side I could make out the dim shape of
the approaching craft. As nearly as I could determine,
it was a large row-boat with at least four
men in it; at all events there were four oars. I
could see and count the phosphorescent swirls as
the blades were dipped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>It was evident at once that the boat was coming
off to the <i>Andromeda</i>. We were anchored well out
in the harbor, and there was nothing beyond us;
nothing but the harbor mouth and the open sea.
Visions of banditry began to flit through my brain.
When I had been last in the Caribbean, some three
months earlier, Nicaragua had been in the throes
of one of its perennial guerrilla wars. A rich man's
yacht, offering dazzling loot, might easily be a
tempting bait to any lawless band happening to
be within striking distance.</p>

<p>While I was straining my eyes to get a better
sight of the approaching boat, and deliberating as
to whether or not I hadn't better call Van Dyck
or the sailing-master, a voice at my elbow said:
"So you are up late, too, are you, Dick?" and I
faced about with a prickling shock of surprise to
find Bonteck standing beside me.</p>

<p>"I must be getting weak-kneed and nervous," I
said. "I thought I was the only person awake at
this end of things, and you gave me a start. What
boat is that?"</p>

<p>"A shore boat, I suppose," he answered evenly.
"After I found that we were likely to be delayed
until to-morrow, I told Goff he might give some of
his men shore leave for a few hours. They were
asking for it."</p>

<p>"But that isn't one of the <i>Andromeda's</i> boats,"
I objected.</p>

<p>"No; they didn't take one of our boats; they
hailed a harbor craft of some sort. I fancied they'd
make a night of it, but it seems they didn't."</p>

<p>"What time is it now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Two bells in the middle watch&mdash;otherwise one
o'clock."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>While we were talking, the boat was pulled up
to the port bows of the yacht and a number of
men, some half-dozen or more, came aboard. We
could see dark figures climbing the rail, but since
the yacht was painted white, and Van Dyck and I
were both wearing yachting flannels, I suppose we
were invisible to the group at the bows. In a
minute or so the boat pushed off, cut a clumsy
half circle in turning, and headed for the shore,
and there was just enough of my foolish nervousness
left to suggest that the oarsmen were still
trying not to make any more noise than they
could help. But the second thought made me
smile at the remains of the nervousness. What
more natural than that our returning shore-leave
men had cautioned the boatmen against making a
racket and waking everybody on the <i>Andromeda?</i></p>

<p>"I take it you've been down with Haskell," I
said to Bonteck, after the shore boat had become
a vanishing blur in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Yes. He is as sore as a boil about that propeller
shaft. Says he never had anything like that
happen to him before, and that it reflects upon him
as chief. He tried to tell me how unaccountable it
was, but I hardly know enough about mechanical
things to keep me from spoiling."</p>

<p>"It is rather unaccountable," I offered. "I was
down a few hours ago and crawled into the shaft
tunnel to have a look at it. Ordinarily, when a
bearing as large as that begins to run dry, it gives
warning some little time beforehand. But Quinby,
Haskell's second, says he put his hand on it less
than an hour before it began to complain, and it
was perfectly cool."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," was Van Dyck's easy-going rejoinder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
"such things are all in a life-time. We're in luck
that it didn't 'seize,' as Haskell says, and twist itself
off. You're yawning as if you were sleepy.
Better turn in and get whatever this hot night will
let you have. Good-night."</p>

<p>That was the end of the day for me, save that
when I went to my stateroom and once more tried
the wall switch the lights came on as usual.</p>

<p>The next morning, after a breakfast so early that
I sat alone at the long table in the white-lacquered
saloon, I went below and offered my services as
those of a highly educated jack-of-all-trades to
Haskell.</p>

<p>"By golly, you're saving my life, Mr. Preble,"
said our chief mechanic, whose eyes were looking
like two burned holes in a blanket. "If you'll
boss the job and let me get about a couple of hours
in the hay&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure," I agreed; and crawling into the extra
suit of overclothes, I proceeded to do it, becoming
so mechanically interested in a short time that I
not only neglected to call Haskell when his two
hours were up, but also let the luncheon hour go
by unheeded.</p>

<p>By keeping faithfully at it, our gang got the
recalcitrant thrust bearing in shape by the middle
of the afternoon, the fires were broken out and the
blowers put on, and by four o'clock the <i>Andromeda</i>
was once more under way and pointing her sharp
nose for the open water. As I came up out of the
engine-hold to make a bolt for a bath and clean
clothes, I saw that Van Dyck had the wheel and
was apparently heading the ship straight out toward
the Mosquito Cays. As the trim little vessel&mdash;which
was little only by comparison with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
great liners of which it was a copy in the small&mdash;went
shearing its way at full speed through the
heaving ground swell with the westering sun fairly
astern, I could not help wondering what our next
port of call would be, and if it would be a disabled
piece of machinery which would drive us into it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>




<h2>VI<br />
<br />
<small>A SEA CHANGE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the Nicaraguan coast fairly astern, and
the <i>Andromeda</i> picking her way gingerly among the
cays and reefs which extend from fifty to one
hundred miles off the eastern hump of the Central
American camel, we soon made the open Caribbean,
and our course was once more laid indefinitely to
the south and east. If we were to hold this general
direction we should bring up in due time somewhere
upon the Colombian or Venezuelan coast of South
America.</p>

<p>Watching my opportunity, I cornered Van Dyck
on the bridge at a moment when he had relieved the
man at the wheel; this on our second evening out
from Gracias á Dios. As I came up, he was changing
the course more to the southward, and I asked
him if we were slated to do the Isthmus and the
Canal.</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought very much about it," he
answered half-absently. "Do you think the others
would like it?"</p>

<p>"The Isthmus is pretty badly hackneyed, nowadays,"
I suggested; "and for your particular
purpose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forget it!" he broke in abruptly. And then:
"It's a hideous failure, Dick, as you have doubtless
found out for yourself."</p>

<p>"Which part of it is a failure&mdash;your experiment,
or the other thing?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean by 'the other
thing'," he bit out.</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you: You thought it wouldn't
be such a bad idea to show Madeleine Barclay what
a vast difference there is between yourself and
Ingerson as a three-meal-a-day proposition; as
a steady diet, so to speak, in an environment
which couldn't very well be changed or broken.
Wasn't that it?"</p>

<p>"Something of the sort, maybe," he admitted,
rather sheepishly, I thought.</p>

<p>"And it isn't working out?"</p>

<p>"You can see for yourself."</p>

<p>"What I see is that you are giving Ingerson a
good bit more than a guest's chance."</p>

<p>"You don't understand," he returned gloomily.</p>

<p>"Naturally. I'm no mind reader."</p>

<p>While the <i>Andromeda</i> was shearing her way
through three of the long Caribbean swells he
was silent. Then he said: "I'm going to tell you,
Dick; I shall have a fit if I don't tell somebody.
Madeleine has turned me down&mdash;not once, you
know, but a dozen times. It's the cursed money!"</p>

<p>"But Ingerson has money, too," I put in.</p>

<p>"I know; but that is different. Can't you conceive
of such a thing as a young woman's turning
down the man she really cares for, and then letting
herself be dragooned into marrying somebody
else?"</p>

<p>"You are asking too much," I retorted. "You
want me to believe that a sane, well-balanced young
woman like Madeleine Barclay will refuse a good
fellow because he happens to be rich, and marry
the other kind of a fellow who has precisely the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
same handicap. It may be only my dull wit, but
I can't see it."</p>

<p>"I could make you see it if you were a little
less thick-headed," he cut in impatiently. And
then he added: "Or if you knew Mr. Holly Barclay
a little better."</p>

<p>It was just here that I began to see a great light,
with Madeleine Barclay threatening to figure as a
modern martyr to a mistaken sense of duty. Did
she know that her father would make his daughter's
husband his banker? And was she generously
refusing to involve the man she loved?</p>

<p>"It ought to make you all the more determined,
Bonteck," I said, after I had reasoned it out. "It
is little less than frightful to think of&mdash;the other
thing, I mean. Ingerson will buy her for so much
cash down; that is about what it will amount to."</p>

<p>"Don't you suppose I know it?" he exclaimed
wrathfully. "Good Lord, Dick, I've racked my
brain until it is sore trying to think up some way
of breaking the combination. You don't know the
worst of it. Holly Barclay is in deep water. Strange
as it may seem, his sister, Emily Vancourt, named
him, of all the incompetents in a silly world, as
her executor and the guardian of her son. The boy
is in college in California, and next year he will
come of age."</p>

<p>"And Barclay can't pay out?"</p>

<p>"You've said it. He has squandered the boy's
fortune as he has Madeleine's. I don't know how
he did it, but I fancy the bucket-shops have had
the most of it. Anyway, it's gone, and when the
fatal day of accounting rolls around he will stand
a mighty good chance of going to jail."</p>

<p>"Does Madeleine know?" I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not the criminal part, you may be sure. She
merely knows that her father is in urgent need of
money&mdash;a good, big chunk of it. And she also
knows, without being told, that the man who
marries her will be invited to step into the breach.
Isn't it horrible?"</p>

<p>"You have discovered the right word for it,"
I agreed. And then: "You are not letting it stand
at that, are you?"</p>

<p>He did not reply at once. From the after-deck
came sounds of cheerful laughter, with Alicia Van
Tromp's rich contralto dominating; came also the
indistinguishable words of a popular song which
Billy Grisdale was chanting to his own mandolin
accompaniment. Presently Jack Grey's mellow
tenor joined in, and in the refrain I could hear
Conetta's silver-toned treble. It jarred upon me a
little; and yet I tried to make myself believe that
I was glad she was happy enough to sing. True
to her word, she had consistently maintained the
barrier quarrelsome between us; and Jerry Dupuyster
was playing his part like an obedient little
soldier.</p>

<p>"You'd say it was a chance for a man to do something
pretty desperate, wouldn't you, Dick?"
Van Dyck said, breaking the long pause in his own
good time.</p>

<p>"I think you would be justified in considering
the end, rather than the particular means," I
conceded.</p>

<p>"I have had a crazy project up my sleeve&mdash;a
sort of forlorn hope, you know. But after working
out all of the details time and again, I've always
weakened on it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps some of the details are weak," I suggested,
willing to be helpful if I could.</p>

<p>"One of them is, and I can't seem to build it up
so that it will seem reasonably plausible. Of
course you know that I'd pay the father out of
the prison risk in the hollow half of a minute if
I could make it appear as anything less than sheer
charity. But I can't do anything like that openly;
and if I should do it in any other ordinary way,
Madeleine would be sure to find out about it and
argue that I was merely lowering myself to Ingerson's
plane&mdash;paving the way with the money that
she despises. And she'd turn me down again&mdash;with
some show of reason. I am still sane enough to
foresee that."</p>

<p>"If Miss Barclay only had some money of her
own with which to buy her release from that
unspeakable father of hers," I began.</p>

<p>"That would break the combination easily,"
he said. "And she did have money once; half
of her mother's fortune was left to her&mdash;with her
father as trustee. It went the same way as Barclay's
own half, and the Vancourt trust fund."</p>

<p>With Conetta's voice in my ears I couldn't
think straight enough to help him much. What I
said was more an echo of my own growing determination
regarding Conetta than anything else.</p>

<p>"I'd fight for my own, Bonteck; and I'd do it
with whatever weapon came handiest," I declared;
and then the return of the steersman whom Van
Dyck had relieved put an end to the confidences
for the time being.</p>

<p>With the sea routine resumed, and the <i>Andromeda</i>
once more steaming free and footloose, a
night and a day elapsed before I again had private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
speech with Van Dyck. As before, it was after
dinner in the evening, and Van Dyck had sent one
of the cabin stewards to ask me to join him in his
stateroom. It was a matchless night, and I was
lounging with the younger members of the ship's
company on the after-deck when the steward came
and whispered to me. We were all singing college
songs with Billy Grisdale's mandolin for an accompaniment,
and I was able to slip away unnoticed.</p>

<p>I found Van Dyck sitting at his table, stepping
off distances on a spread-out chart with a pair of
compasses, and somehow I fancied that the air
of the luxuriously fitted little den was surcharged
with the electricity of portent.</p>

<p>"You sent for me?" I queried.</p>

<p>"Yes; sit down and light your pipe," and he
motioned me to a chair. "What are the others
doing?"</p>

<p>"The young people, with the Greys, are on the
after-deck, caterwauling with Billy, as you can
hear. There is a bridge table in full blast in the
saloon, with Mrs. Van Tromp, Aunt Mehitable,
Holly Barclay and Ingerson sitting in. The Sanfords
have disappeared&mdash;gone to bed, I imagine;
and the major is in the smoking-room, guzzling
hot toddies."</p>

<p>"Good!" was the brief rejoinder. "Everything
quiet up forward?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes&mdash;for all I know to the contrary," I
answered in some little surprise. "Why shouldn't
it be quiet?"</p>

<p>For a moment Van Dyck seemed embarrassed.
And his explanation, when he made it, was half
halting.</p>

<p>"There has been some little trouble with&mdash;er&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
crew, you know. Quite likely you haven't
seen any signs of it. I&mdash;I've been trying to keep
it under cover as well as I could."</p>

<p>"Trouble?&mdash;of what sort?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;er&mdash;the only kind one ever has with a
crew; something like a threatened mutiny, I
believe."</p>

<p>I laughed aloud.</p>

<p>"A mutiny on a private yacht? Why, heavens
and earth&mdash;your men don't have anything to do
but to draw their pay and their breath!"</p>

<p>"I know; that is the way it would appear. But
there is something behind&mdash;something you don't
understand. If I should tell you that the <i>Andromeda</i>
left New York with a quarter of a million
dollars in her hold&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's that?" I ejaculated, shocked into sudden
and lively attention.</p>

<p>"You must forgive me, Dick, if I don't go into
the particulars," he went on hastily. "I might
say, with a good degree of truth, that it isn't
altogether my own secret. But&mdash;but the fact
remains."</p>

<p>"A quarter of a mil&mdash;Great Caesar!" I gasped.
Then the deductive part of my brain began to fit
the fragmentary admissions into a probable whole.
All summer there had been flying rumors in the
West India ports of a revolution brewing in one
of the South American republics; an upheaval
which was to be financed&mdash;in the interests of a great
importing corporation&mdash;by New York capital.
Could it be possible that Van Dyck had foolishly
allowed his yacht to be made use of as a money
transport?</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that we have that money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
on board now?" I protested, when the possible
consequences began to make themselves manifest.</p>

<p>"As it happens, we haven't," he replied, quite
calmly. "That is why it took the <i>Andromeda</i> so
long to make the run from New York to Havana.
I was getting rid of the impedimenta."</p>

<p>"But if you've gotten rid of it, why should your
crew&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is just the point," he explained patiently.
"The thing had to be done quietly, and proper
precautions were taken at both ends of the line to
keep anybody and everybody from finding out that
we were carrying a small fortune between-decks.
Still, I am afraid it did leak out. That little
black-mustached fellow who turned up at Havana,
and again in New Orleans&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That reminds me of something that occurred
to me no longer ago than this morning's breakfast-time,"
I broke in; "a thing that I've been meaning
to ask you about ever since. Manuel, the mulatto
boy who usually serves breakfast, was invisible
this morning, and he had a substitute."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I was going to say that, if I'm not greatly mistaken,
you have that same mysterious little man&mdash;minus
the mustaches&mdash;on your payroll at this
moment, Bonteck. He is the under-steward who
goes by the name of Lequat; he was the man who
substituted for Manuel this morning, and he was
the man who came to me just now to tell me that
you wanted me."</p>

<p>It was now Van Dyck's turn to sit up and take
notice and he did both, emphatically.</p>

<p>"That fellow?&mdash;In the <i>Andromeda?</i>" he exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"As I say&mdash;if I'm not much mistaken. I had a
pretty good chance to familiarize myself with his
face that night in the hotel dining-room in New
Orleans, and I have a fairly decent memory for
faces."</p>

<p>Van Dyck fell into a muse, breaking the silence
finally to say: "By Jove, Dick, that may prove
to be a horse of another color, don't you know!"</p>

<p>Waiving the question as to what the color of
the original horse might have been, I stuck to the
point at issue.</p>

<p>"If, as you say, you have gotten rid of the money,
the situation can't be very alarming. Including
engineers, firemen and cabin servants, you can't
have over thirty-five or forty men in the crew, all
told. There are nine of us in the cabin, and Haskell
and the Americans will all stand with us. If
we get together and put up a good front&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Van Dyck interrupted hastily&mdash;over-hastily, I
thought, for a man of his inches and determination
in other fields.</p>

<p>"It is not to be thought of, Dick; not for a
single moment, with all these women aboard. Besides,
we have no arms. We'd be shot down in
cold blood if it should come to blows."</p>

<p>This was so singularly unlike the Bonteck Van
Dyck I had known best in the college days that it
fairly made me gasp.</p>

<p>"Why, Bonteck!" I exclaimed; "what has come
over you? You don't mean to say that you would
calmly hand the yacht over to those fellows if
they should ask you for it?"</p>

<p>"It might easily be the only thing to do," he
asserted, half mechanically. "Of course, as I say,
we haven't the money, and they would have their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
trouble for their pains, after all. Still, it might be
difficult to convince them that the gol&mdash;the money
has been actually disposed of. If they learned in
New York that we really took it on board, and
didn't learn afterward that it was disembarked
elsewhere .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, you see how it stacks up,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"I see that you are making mountains out of
molehills," I retorted. "What does Goff say about
this potential mutiny?"</p>

<p>Van Dyck shook his head as if the mention of
Goff merely added to the difficulties of the situation.</p>

<p>"That is another thing: Goff may be in it himself.
He is an awful tough-looking old pirate.
Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"What I think is that you must have been completely
off your head when you changed from your
Atlantic-liner master and crew to this old fisherman
and his Portuguese."</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;somebody recommended him; I forget just
who it was," he went on to explain. "I needed a
sailing-master who knew the Caribbean well, and
who would do what he was told to do and ask
no questions. You see the&mdash;er&mdash;shipping of the
quarter million made some difference, and I couldn't
afford to have too much intelligence aboard."</p>

<p>Again there was a pause, during which I was
trying to persuade myself that this half-hearted
young man across the stateroom table from me
was really the same Bonteck Van Dyck who had
coached crews, captained the 'Varsity football, and
had otherwise proved himself a man and a leader
of men&mdash;the sort of leader who fights to the final
gasp, and even then doesn't know when he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
beaten. The inability to do it put a little unconscious
scorn into my summing-up of the situation.</p>

<p>"It is up to you, of course," I said. "We are
merely your guests, and what you say is what we
shall do. At the same time, I think&mdash;in fact I
know&mdash;that you could count upon practically every
man in our much-mixed passenger list to help
you put down a mutiny."</p>

<p>"That is it&mdash;that is just why I sent for you,
Dick," he cut in eagerly. "I knew you would be
all for making a fight, and that you would probably
lead it. For the sake of the women there mustn't
be any scrap, you know. It would scare them into
hysterics, naturally. If it should come to a showdown
we must just make up our minds to take it
easy&mdash;take the line of the least resistance&mdash;if you
get what I mean. At the very worst, the mutineers
couldn't well do more than to put us ashore
somewhere, so that they might have a chance to
search the yacht for the money. I have had that
in mind all along, and when you came in just now
I was trying to figure out our present latitude and
longitude. Have you any idea where we are?"</p>

<p>"Trying to figure out?" I echoed. "Do you
mean to tell me calmly that you&mdash;a navigator
yourself and the owner of this ship&mdash;don't <i>know</i>
where we are?"</p>

<p>"I'm ashamed to admit that I don't know&mdash;precisely.
Goff keeps the reckoning, you see, and
I have thought that perhaps he wasn't giving me
the correct figures."</p>

<p>If any additional evidence had been needed, here
was another and still more startling proof of the
devastating change which had somehow been
wrought in the Bonteck Van Dyck I had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
thinking I knew. One of his hobbies in the past
had been the study of practical navigation, and on
more than one long cruise he had been his own
sailing-master. That he should deliberately turn
the <i>Andromeda</i> over to a man who had been merely
"recommended" by some one whose name was
already forgotten was little short of astounding.</p>

<p>"I truly hope there is nothing worse than an
ordinary, every-day mutiny in store for us," I said
grimly. "Judging from our course&mdash;which Goff
may have changed every night, for all you seem
to know&mdash;we ought to be somewhere in the southern
half of the Caribbean. The steamer lanes are
well charted, but there are a good many cays and
islands outside of them&mdash;places where the bones of
the <i>Andromeda</i> might lie until they rotted before
anybody would ever discover them."</p>

<p>"And not all of the islands are inhabited, I take
it," said Van Dyck, peering down at his chart as
if he hoped to identify some of them.</p>

<p>"You know that as well as I do&mdash;or better," I
snapped. And then: "What in the name of common
sense has turned you into such a milk-blooded
shuffler, Bonteck? You talk and act as if you
weren't more than half&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen!" he said hastily, holding up a warning
finger.</p>

<p>The stringy tinkle of Billy Grisdale's mandolin
had stopped, and with it the singing. Above
the murmuring diapason of the yacht's engines
we both heard Edie Van Tromp's shrill cry of
"Land-o-o-o!" As if the cry had been a pre-concerted
signal, it was followed instantly by a
confused trampling of feet on the deck over our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
heads, a sudden slackening of the yacht's speed,
and more cries and foot-tramplings.</p>

<p>I was upon my feet and was reaching for the
door-knob when Mrs. Van Tromp's throaty scream
came from the adjoining saloon where the bridge
players were sitting. Before I could turn the knob
the door was thrust open, and the under-steward,
whose ship name was Lequat, backed by two evil-faced
fore-deck men armed with rifles, stood in the
doorway. At the appearance of this warlike demonstration
I was glad to see that Van Dyck, for
once in a way, seemed genuinely shocked.</p>

<p>"You?" he demanded. "How is this? Where
is Mr. Goff?"</p>

<p>The little man's smile and bow were like those
of a dancing master.</p>

<p>"Ze captaine is sand me to inform you zat you
are both ze prisonaire, <i>oui</i>. You vill sit down in
ze chair and wait patient', M'sieu' Van Dyck&mdash;and
you, Mistaire Preb'. Zis ees w'at you call all
cut-and-dry, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I suppose I sprang at his throat; it was the only
thing for a live man to do. But the little beggar
was quicker than a cat, and he brought me up all
standing, with a huge pistol thrust into my face.</p>

<p>"Aha! you vill choke me, ees it? By gar, Mistaire
Preb', eet is possib' I make you&mdash;how you
say it?&mdash;walk ze board&mdash;ze plank, yes? You vill
sit down on ze chair and tek eet easy. Ze sheep
ees belong to h-us, and your fran's 'ave all been
lock' up in ze staterooms. You can do notting;
<i>moi</i>, Alphonse Lequat, vill tek ze comman'."</p>

<p>It was not until after all of this had happened
that Van Dyck found his voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is this&mdash;is this a mutiny, Lequat?" he asked,
as mild as mush.</p>

<p>"Eet is vat you vill be please' to call heem,
M'sieu' Van Dyck, <i>certainement</i>. For fifteen,
twanty, feefty minute' you vill sit on ze chair,
and Pedro, he is stay outside ze door and keel
you eef you make noises. Bam-by, <i>moi</i>, Alphonse
Lequat, s'all come back to tell you vat eet is you
s'all do." And then to his men: "<i>Allons, mes
garçons!</i>"</p>

<p>And with that he backed out of the owner's private
cabin, and shut and locked the door.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>




<h2>VII<br />
<br />
<small>SHORE LEAVE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Coincident</span> with the taking over of the yacht
by the mutineers, the engines stopped; but after
Lequat had locked us in and left us, the trampling
tune of the machinery began again, though it
presently became apparent that we were proceeding
at something less than half speed. At first I thought
the creeping progress might be Haskell's way of
showing his reluctance to obey his new masters;
but after the engines had made a few of the slow
revolutions we heard the sing-song cry of a seaman
in the main chains taking soundings.</p>

<p>"Feeling for an anchorage," said Van Dyck,
speaking for the first time since he had asked Lequat
that mush-mild question as to whether or not the
outbreak was a mutiny. "Wouldn't you put it
up that way?"</p>

<p>His query seemed too trivial to merit an answer.</p>

<p>"I haven't any time to waste on the guesses,"
I said, and most likely the tone was as crabbed as
the words. Then: "Are you fully awake at last?
Do you realize that you've been held up and robbed
of a five-hundred-thousand-dollar yacht?"</p>

<p>His shrug was perfectly spineless.</p>

<p>"'What can't be cured must be endured',"
he quoted, handing me the time-worn maxim as if
it sufficiently accounted for everything. "Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
course, as the person chiefly responsible, I'm all
kinds of sorry for you and the others. It's a horribly
rude interruption to our pleasure jaunt, and
I take it there is no telling what these fellows may
do to us." Then, with still more of the air of the
completest detachment: "The nervy beggars! Who
would ever have suspected it of them? And to
carry it off so neatly, too."</p>

<p>"It was all plotted and planned beforehand, of
course. Didn't this man Lequat say that it was
cut-and-dried? Goff is the head and front of it,
isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Heaven knows. You wouldn't imagine it of
Goff&mdash;or would you?"</p>

<p>"I can easily imagine him breaking rock in a
Federal prison&mdash;which is what he will do&mdash;if he
succeeds in keeping his leathery old neck out of
the hangman's noose!"</p>

<p>"Naturally," Van Dyck agreed easily. "But
that is an after consideration. The present realities
are what concern us just now. I'm wondering
what their next move will be."</p>

<p>"You don't seem to be letting your wonderment
disturb you very much." I was still warm, both
over the bootless little tussle with Lequat, and
because Van Dyck had so ignominiously failed to
rise to the occasion&mdash;and was still continuing to
fail.</p>

<p>"What's the use?" he queried. "We are like
the harmless and inoffensive citizen who wakes up
in the middle of the night to find a burglar's spot-light
shining in his eyes and the burglar's gun shoved
in his face. Discretion is always the better part of
valor. Haven't you learned that invaluable lesson,
knocking about in this harsh old world? But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
getting back to things present and pressing&mdash;there
goes our anchor."</p>

<p>The brief roar of the cable running through its
hawse-hole told us that the <i>Andromeda</i> was in comparatively
shallow soundings. We could feel the
snub of the anchor as the yacht's way was checked,
and a little later the sounds overhead advertised
the fact that the mutineers were lowering one of
the boats.</p>

<p>Beyond the slap of the lowered boat as it took
the water, the noises were less easily definable.
There were bumpings and bangings which seemed
to come from forward of the bridge, muffled sounds
like those of a busy baggage-room at train-time,
the shrilling of blocks and tackle, and a skirling
chatter suggestive of a steam winch in action.
Following these we could hear the low humming
of the motor in the dropped electric launch; a
murmur which gradually died away as we listened.</p>

<p>Somewhat farther along, after the buzzing motor
murmur had come and gone often enough to tell
us that the launch was plying industriously between
the yacht and some other destination, Van
Dyck said: "You'd say they were taking an entire
cargo ashore, wouldn't you?&mdash;provided the <i>Andromeda</i>
carried any cargo." Then: "I've cornered
a guess, Dick&mdash;which you may have for what it
is worth. I believe these fellows are meaning to
take a leaf out of the book of the old buccaneers
of the Spanish Main and maroon us."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Putting two and two together. That is the
hoist winch making all the clatter up forward. They
are unloading the forehold&mdash;of our dunnage and
some part of the provisions, we'll say&mdash;and lightering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the stuff ashore in the launch. Assuming
that they expect to find a quarter of a million
dollars hidden away somewhere in the <i>Andromeda</i>,
they'll figure that they need to get rid of us, and
run fast and far to make their get-away, won't
they?"</p>

<p>"That sounds sufficiently barbarous to fit in
with the rest of it," I fumed.</p>

<p>"Right-o. That being the case, they have only
to stow us away in some safe place&mdash;where we
won't be found and rescued too soon&mdash;and then up
stick and away; put steam to the yacht and vanish.
Once they get going, they'll be safe enough. The
<i>Andromeda</i> will outrun anything of her inches, short
of the torpedo chasers and the hydroplanes, when
she is pushed to it. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I'm not saying anything," I returned crustily.
"I'm too busy wondering what in Heaven's name
has thinned your blood to the milk-and-water
consistency, Bonteck. I've heard a few queer
things about you during the past three years, but
I wasn't told that you had gone completely dippy.
Why, man alive! if your guess is right, you stand
to lose a cool half-million in the value of the yacht&mdash;to
say nothing of what may happen to the bunch
of us if we are marooned on some lonesome island
in the southern Caribbean!"</p>

<p>"Yes, there is the marooning to be considered,
of course," he said coolly, filling his pipe and lighting
it. "But we needn't cross that bridge until
we come to it. As to the possible loss of the yacht,
that is the least of my troubles, just now. She'll
turn up again somewhere, I guess; if they don't
smash or sink her."</p>

<p>It seemed utterly hopeless to try to arouse him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to any adequate sense of the enormity of the
thing that had befallen us, and I jumped up and
began to pace the narrow limits of the little cabin.
Van Dyck's attitude seemed explainable only upon
the hypothesis that he had lost his mind, and I
wondered if his brooding over the wretched dilemma
into which his love for Madeleine Barclay had
plunged him hadn't thrown him off his balance. It
was certainly beginning to look that way.</p>

<p>While I was tramping back and forth in a fever
of gloomy rage and helplessness, with Van Dyck
sitting at the table and calmly smoking his pipe,
the ship's noises took new forms. There was much
tramping up and down the saloon stairs, a rattling
of keys in locks, opening and shutting of doors,
and the like. Again and again the motor launch
repeated its short trips, and between two of them
there were voices raised in the adjoining saloon;
Ingerson's in savage and profane protest, and Mrs.
Van Tromp's in tearful inquiry as to what had
been done with Mr. Van Dyck. In due course of
time our own turn came, and it was Lequat who
unlocked and opened our door.</p>

<p>"Ze momment ees come," he announced, with a
bow and a smirk. "Ze anchor ees&mdash;vat ees it you
say?&mdash;hove short, and ze launch ees wait' for you
zhentleman. You vill come peaceab'?&mdash;or ees it
that ve have to asseest you?"</p>

<p>It was now or never, if we meant to try conclusions
with this little scoundrel, and I looked
to Van Dyck for the answer. He had put on his
cap, slung a cased field-glass over his shoulder, and
was closing and locking the drawers of the writing-table.
As I have said, it was his final chance for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
making some show of resistance, and he was
weakly letting it go.</p>

<p>When we reached the deck, guarded closely by
four or five of the mutineers, it became evident
that we were the last of the ship's company to be
summoned. The night was fine, with a sickle of a
moon in its first quarter, and the sea undisturbed
by so much as a ripple. The <i>Andromeda</i> was at
anchor a short distance from one of the many cays
with which the southern Caribbean is dotted; a
long, low-lying island plumed with palms and
densely jungled with tropical undergrowth. The
yacht lay within a stone's throw of an outer reef,
and the reef enclosed a broad lagoon reflecting the
shadows of the palms like a silver mirror under
the shimmering moonlight; and the shadowy background
of foliage was made blacker by contrast
with a ribbon of white sand beach.</p>

<p>Though there was a passage through the reef
just opposite the <i>Andromeda's</i> temporary berth, the
mutineers had apparently been too cautious to
try to enter it with the yacht. They had merely
felt their way with the sounding line to within
bottoming distance on the outside of the reef, and
dropped the anchor. There was little question now
as to their intention. They were stopping only
long enough to get rid of us.</p>

<p>In ominous silence Van Dyck and I were herded
toward the accommodation ladder, at the foot of
which lay the electric launch. Up to the final
moment I was hoping to see Bonteck reassert
himself, at least to the extent of protesting against
the high-handed crime these scoundrels were committing.
When it became apparent that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
not going to say anything, I took a chance for
myself.</p>

<p>"I suppose you know what you are doing,
Lequat," I barked, after we had taken our places
in the launch. "This is piracy on the high seas, and
you don't have to be much of a sailorman to know
what that means."</p>

<p>"You vill not be trouble you'self 'bout me,
Mistaire Preb'," he returned politely. Then, as
the man at the ladder foot pushed us off: "<i>Bon
voyage</i>, M'sieu' Van Dyck. <i>Bon soir</i>, and&mdash;how
you say it?&mdash;G-o-o-d-by!"</p>

<p>The launch, manned by a crew numerous enough
to have thrown us overboard if we had raised a
hand in rebellion, sped silently across to the narrow
inlet in the reef and entered the peaceful lagoon.
Almost at once a sickening, terrifying conviction
began to force itself upon me. From the first
out-of-door glance at the surroundings there had
been something familiar in the appearance of the
reef, the pond-like lagoon, and the low-lying island.
As we were passing through the inlet the moonbeams
struck out the black and shattered remains
of a wreck hanging upon the outer reef a short
distance on our right, and then I <i>knew!</i></p>

<p>"The Lord have mercy!" I gasped; and Van
Dyck looked up quickly.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The wreck of the <i>Mary Jane!</i>" I whispered,
pointing to the black skeleton on the rocks. "This
is the island I told you about&mdash;the horrible place
where we were shipwrecked a year ago last winter!"</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" he returned; and then, to
make the reply still more trite: "What a remarkable
coincidence!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>His indifference was maddening, and my temper&mdash;the
temper that had once cost me any shadow of
a chance that I might have had in persuading Miss
Mehitable Gilmore that, money or no money, Conetta's
happiness, as well as my own, was of more
importance than any mere fortune lost or gained&mdash;this
flyaway temper got the better of me and I said
things for which I was sorry the moment they
were said.</p>

<p>"Pile it on as thick as you please, old man,"
Van Dyck rejoined, meekly, after I had abused
him like an angry fishwife. "It is coming to you&mdash;and
to the others, as well. What they will do
to me presently will doubtless be good and plenty,
and you'll have your revenge."</p>

<p>Two minutes later the launch was nosing the
white sand of the beach, and the man at the tiller
made motions for us to get out. Van Dyck stepped
ashore and I followed him. A few yards away, at
the edge of the jungle thicketing, our cabin castaways
were huddled around a great pile of luggage
and ship's stores. Their greeting of Van Dyck
when he joined them was all that his most vindictive
accuser could have desired; cries and reproaches,
eager questionings and sobbing protests
from the women; and from the men a fierce storm
of demandings led by the major and Holly Barclay.
Since Jerry Dupuyster made no move to do it, I
drew Conetta quickly out of the Babel and walked
her beyond earshot. Major Terwilliger was so far
forgetting himself as to swear savagely at his late
host, and Ingerson's language was brutal.</p>

<p>"Tell me, reasonably and sanely, if you can,
Dick, just what has been done to us," urged my
companion, with a little shiver of fright or disgust&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
possibly of both; this when we paused to
watch the retreating launch cleave its way across
the lagoon to the waiting yacht.</p>

<p>"I don't know very much more about it than
you do," I told her. "There is a mutiny, with a
plot to steal the <i>Andromeda</i>, it seems, and it is
quite evident the thing was carefully planned. I
was below when it climaxed and so saw nothing
of what was happening on deck. They didn't hurt
anybody, did they?"</p>

<p>"I think not. It came so suddenly that they
didn't need to use force. We were under the awning,
just as you left us. Edie Van Tromp saw this
island and called out 'Land-o,' and the next thing
we knew a lot of men with guns had surrounded
us and were ordering us to go to our staterooms
and to be quick about it. That little dark-faced
under-steward who talks so brokenly seemed to be
the leader. He was polite enough about it, but
when Jack Grey and Billy began to protest, he
made four of his men grab them."</p>

<p>"Then you were hustled below?"</p>

<p>"Yes. When we got down to the saloon, more
of the armed men were shoving the bridge players
into the staterooms, and Hobart Ingerson was
swearing awfully. So was the major when they
dragged him out of the smoking-room."</p>

<p>"They are swearing yet," I said. "What did
your aunt say?"</p>

<p>"She didn't say a single word; she just walked
into our stateroom ahead of me, as stiff as a poker,
and I couldn't get a word out of her. I don't know
whether she was scared, or just too angry for words.
She sat on the edge of her bed like a frozen statue
until they came to take us ashore. What are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
wretches going to do?&mdash;leave us here on this deserted
little strip of an island?"</p>

<p>The answer to her question was at that very
moment shaping itself before our eyes. While its
propeller was still churning idly, the electric launch
was hooked and hoisted to its davits, the anchor
was broken out, and the <i>Andromeda</i> began to forge
slowly ahead, again with a man in the bow heaving
the lead and calling out the soundings.</p>

<p>"We are marooned," I said soberly enough, I
guess. "It may be for a day, a week, a month or
a year. I happen to know this island only too
well. I was shipwrecked upon it once. Those are
the bones of our old schooner, the <i>Mary Jane</i>, out
yonder on the reef."</p>

<p>She gave a little gasp of shocked surprise.</p>

<p>"You shipwrecked?&mdash;and I never heard of it!"
she exclaimed. "How long were you here, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Nearly a month. A tramp steamer, blown out
of its course between Colon and La Guaira by a
hurricane, saw our signals and took us off."</p>

<p>She glanced over her shoulder apprehensively.</p>

<p>"There are no&mdash;no savages, are there?" she shuddered.</p>

<p>I shook my head. "Hardly; not in the twentieth
century. For that matter, I doubt if there
ever were any. The place isn't big enough to support
much of a population."</p>

<p>We were walking again now, keeping to the hard
sands, and turning our backs resolutely upon the
vanishing white phantom which was the ship that
was deserting us.</p>

<p>"There are eighteen of us," Conetta said, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
a time. "Doesn't that mean starvation, sooner or
later?"</p>

<p>"There were six of us who were washed ashore
from the <i>Mary Jane</i>," I said. "We lived on shell
fish and cocoanuts&mdash;just barely, as you might say.
There is a tradition that we were not the first, and
that the others, the crew of a Spanish treasure ship
marooned by the old English sea rovers, did starve."</p>

<p>"Heavens!" she breathed. "The place ought to
be full of ghosts! But you don't believe those terrible
old tales, do you?"</p>

<p>"They were true enough, doubtless; but we
needn't go out of our way to localize them. In
the present instance&mdash;&mdash;" I was about to tell her
of the remains of the ancient wreck farther down
the beach, but I thought better of it and switched&mdash;"in
the present instance we are not going to
starve, for a while, at least. The mutineers have
given us a fighting chance by dividing the ship's
stores with us. Didn't you hear the launch going
back and forth before you were taken off?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard it," she acknowledged. "That
must have been part of the plan, too." Then she
stopped and faced me suddenly. "Where was
Bonteck while all the rest of us were being hustled
out of the way?"</p>

<p>"He was a prisoner in his stateroom, locked in,
and with a man on guard."</p>

<p>She looked me squarely in the eyes after a disconcerting
fashion which might have been acquired
from her downright aunt.</p>

<p>"Do you know that, Dick? Or is it only a
friendly guess?"</p>

<p>"I know it because I was locked in with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
The mutineers had given us our orders&mdash;told us
that we were down and out, you know."</p>

<p>"And you made no resistance&mdash;you two?"</p>

<p>I didn't say anything about my futile attempt
to choke Lequat.</p>

<p>"Bonteck seemed to be afraid of a general massacre,
or something of that sort, if we should put
up a fight."</p>

<p>"I'm not satisfied," she returned promptly. "It
is too absurd. Could a thing like this have been
planned without some hint of it getting to Bonteck?
And then there is Mr. Goff: you don't mean to
tell me that that crabbed, sour, shrimmy old piece
of New England honesty and prying curiosity could
be kept from finding out."</p>

<p>"Bonteck hints that Goff may be heading the
mutiny."</p>

<p>"That," said Conetta, with calm conviction, "is
simply nonsense. I wouldn't believe it, not if Mr.
Goff told me so himself." And then: "Shall we
go back to the others now? The storm seems to
have blown itself out: and we mustn't forget&mdash;you
and I&mdash;that we have agreed to disagree."</p>

<p>Her use of Aunt Mehitable's phrase touched off
that cursed temper of mine again, and if I had
made any reply at all it would have been one that
I should have repented of. So we walked back to
the haphazard landing place in sober silence.</p>

<p>When we joined the main body of castaways it
seemed that Van Dyck had contrived by some
means to stem the storm of question and reproach
and to quiet it, for the time, at least. The women
were sitting apart on the boxes of canned things,
and Grey and Grisdale, under Bonteck's directions,
and with his help, were setting up the three tents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
which the mutineers' generosity, or chivalry, had
included in our dunnage. Somebody had kindled
a small fire on the beach, but the night was so
warm that, apart from the cheer of it, the blaze
served no purpose other than to light up the somber
faces turned toward it.</p>

<p>After the tent-pegging&mdash;in which I hastened to
share a part when I saw what was toward&mdash;we
four made an attack upon the boxed stores. There
were provisions in plenty; meats in canvas and
meats in tins, vegetables fresh and vegetables in
cans, ship's biscuit, and a variety of the other more
ornamental&mdash;and less filling&mdash;kind; tea, coffee, sugar
and evaporated cream; all of the calories to
make a balanced ration. Last, but not least, there
was a beaker of fresh water, though as to this,
there were two good springs on the island, and a
rill from one of them was trickling into the lagoon
a few yards from our landing place.</p>

<p>Besides the necessary proteins, hydrocarbons
and the like, there were a few of the luxuries; a
case of liquors, a box of candles, another of cigars,
cigarettes and tobacco, soap and towels, and even
a couple of mirrors ravished from the bulkheads of
the <i>Andromeda</i>&mdash;these last, I dare swear, a thought
of the dancing-master Lequat's.</p>

<p>For beds there was a bale of canvas hammocks;
and somebody's chivalric promptings&mdash;Lequat's or
another's&mdash;had gone the length of including the
baggage-hold-stored steamer trunks of the women,
though we men had only the clothes we stood in.</p>

<p>Before our amateur camp was fully pitched the
dark cloud of dismay and disheartenment began to
show rifts here and there. After all was said, we
were all alive and well, with plenty to eat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
drink, and with no immediate prospect of hardship.
Perhaps it was no matter for surprise that
Sanford, the absent-minded professor of mathematics,
was the first to rise to the philosophical
demands of the occasion.</p>

<p>"I dare say there isn't a civilized human being
in the world who hasn't, at one time or another,
wished to be situated just as we find ourselves at
the present moment," he began, after Grey and
Billy Grisdale and the Van Tromp girls had goaded
him into his proper class-room-lecturer's attitude.
"For the time being&mdash;which we may very properly
hope will not be unduly extended beyond the pleasant
and profitable limit&mdash;we shall be able to live
in a little world of our own making. If we have
any resources of our own to fall back upon&mdash;and I
trust none of us is wholly lacking in that respect&mdash;we
may prove and try them, and quite possibly
we may discover that, after all, environment, the
conventions, the social machinery with which our
civilization has surrounded us, are by no means
strictly necessary to the sane, normal human being.
Let us, therefore, eat and drink, and be thankful
that things are no worse with us than we are at
present finding them."</p>

<p>As if he had been an after-dinner speaker rising
to express his pleasure at being among us, the professor
was heartily applauded, and, following his
suggestion, we had a bed-time snack of biscuits and
tea around the handful of camp-fire. And, such
is the force of good example, by the time the second
pannikin of water was boiling, the younger members
were making a jest of the most serious adventure
that had ever befallen any of them. Jerry
Dupuyster was pouring tea for Beatrice Van Tromp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Conetta had deliberately left her aunt's side to
come and sit on the sand between Annette Grey
and me; and Madeleine Barclay, as fetchingly beautiful
in her white yachting flannels as she had ever
appeared in her richest dinner gown, was listening
patiently&mdash;nay, sympathetically, I thought&mdash;to
Bonteck's well-worn explanation (which did not
explain) of how it had all come about.</p>

<p>To offset these cheerful ameliorations there were
a sufficient number of death's heads at the feast,
as a matter of course. Major Terwilliger, contemplating
a prospect which promised little in the
way of his cherished diversions, sat apart and
grumbled peevishly because the tea tasted smoky.
Holly Barclay, robbed at one sheer stroke of all
the little refinements and luxuries which made the
sum of his aimless and worthless life, was still in
the bickering stage; and Ingerson, with the few
restraints which he recognized stricken away, was
a plain brute, taking no pains to conceal his angry
disgust, and making snappish bids to be let alone
when any one was charitable enough to speak to
him.</p>

<p>As for the women, the three who would be the
first to feel the pinch of any privations that might
come upon us were behaving beautifully, putting
the major's gloom and Barclay's pettishness and
Ingerson's grumpy rage to shame. Mrs. Van
Tromp&mdash;a most easy-going soul when she could
forget for the moment that she had three marriageable,
and as yet unmarried, daughters on her hands&mdash;had
already forgotten her reproachful complainings.
Conetta's Aunt Mehitable was arguing peacefully
with the professor on the philosophical aspect
of the situation, though quite without prejudice, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
fancied, to the sharp eye she was keeping upon
Conetta in her new juxtaposition between Annette
Grey and me. Mrs. Sanford, who, in spite of her
motherliness, was a frail little body physically, was
apparently regarding the hammock beds with some
degree of trepidation; nevertheless, she went on
sipping her tea with evident relish, and she found
time and the spirit to smile understandingly across
the circle at Billy Grisdale and Edie Van Tromp,
and to stoop and pat Billy's bull pup, when the
dog, finding that his master had no present use for
him, wandered from one to another to stick his
extremely <i>retroussé</i> nose into any hospitable palm
that offered.</p>

<p>"Shall we be able to keep this up, do you suppose?"
Conetta whispered to me, between the last
two bites of her biscuit.</p>

<p>"I think the moonlight, what there is of it, is
entrancingly beautiful, don't you?" I laughed.
"'Sufficient unto the day (or night)&mdash;&mdash;' You
know the rest of it. I'm willing to let to-morrow
take care of itself. Are you?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I am." Then, with a return to the old-time
dartings aside: "What do you imagine Jerry
is finding so alluring in Bee Van Tromp? He has
never read a book in his life."</p>

<p>"Beatrice isn't all book," I retorted. "On this
voyage which has come to such an abrupt halt I
have been finding her a very charming young
woman. Her eyes, now."</p>

<p>"Shush! Any woman can make eyes at a man.
If you'll look around at me, I'll show you."</p>

<p>"Not any more," I said, and the saying was
purely in self-defense.</p>

<p>"Wait," she teased. "The island is small&mdash;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
said it was, didn't you?&mdash;and you can't always
look the other way." Then: "Can't we even
quarrel decently, Dickie Preble?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Tromp was rising stiffly and I was
saved the necessity of replying.</p>

<p>"Time to go to bed, my dears," said the mother
of three with great good-nature. And then to me:
"Dick Preble, are you sure you fastened my hammock
securely? Because, if you didn't&mdash;well, you
know&mdash;I'm dreadfully heavy. There now! Wild
horses wouldn't have dragged that admission out
of me at home. Conetta, you rogue, you're laughing
at me, but you're blushing, as well, and that's
one of the conventions, too. Never mind. I'm
afraid every second step will be on a crab, or a
scorpion, or some other hideous thing. Good-night,
all!"</p>

<h2>VIII<br />
<br />
<small>INTO THE PRIMITIVE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was I who told Edie Van Tromp that the
name, or legendary name, of our island was "Pirates'
Hope," and when she announced it at our
first camp breakfast it was acclaimed with a cheerful
unanimity which went far to show how, after a
night's rest, we were able to make a jest out of
what had figured, only a few hours earlier, as a
crude calamity.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Van Dyck, throwing off the
lethargy which had apparently bound him hand
and foot when a little decision might have turned
the tables upon the mutineers, took his place energetically
and capably as the governor of our little
colony. Under his directions a signal was set at
the nearer, or western, end of the island, enough
of the jungle was cleared to enable us to pitch the
tents under the shade of the palms, a cooking camp
was established, and a rude thatched shelter was
built to protect the stores and luggage.</p>

<p>In these various industries there were only three
idlers among the men&mdash;the major, Holly Barclay,
and Hobart Ingerson; and Edie Van Tromp, volunteering
to go with me to start a smoke fire at the
signal cape, was furious.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't that set your back teeth on edge, seeing
those three able-bodied gentlemen sunning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
themselves on the beach while everybody else is
getting blisters on their hands!" she flamed out,
with a fine disregard for the little grammatical inaccuracies.
"I'd be ashamed!"</p>

<p>"You shouldn't deny the gentlemen the privilege
of smoking their after-breakfast cigars in comfort,"
I protested, grinning. "Perhaps, after the
cigars are all gone, and we come down to just
plain pipes and plebeian cut-plug tobacco&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care! It's perfectly horrid of them, <i>I</i>
think. Mother got us women together this morning
while you men were fixing the tents, and we
all agreed to do the cooking, taking turns at it.
When it comes my turn, I shall tell those three
loafing gentlemen that they can undertake to wash
the dishes, or go hungry!"</p>

<p>"Good!" I applauded. "You are a real, honest-to-goodness
human woman, under the skin, aren't
you, Edie?"</p>

<p>She stuck out a pretty under lip at me.</p>

<p>"Did you ever, for one little fraction of a minute,
doubt it, Mr. Richard Preble?"</p>

<p>"No; it is only fair to say that I have never
doubted it. You and Billy are the real thing,
whatever may be said for the remainder of us."</p>

<p>"Billy is a darling!" she declared enthusiastically.
"Last night, when those pirates rushed us
with their guns, you know, I wanted to cry; boo-hoo
right out like a silly baby. It was just plain scare.
A grown man would have tried to comfort me, I
suppose, but Billy joshed me and made fun of me
until I was too mad to be scared. Isn't it a thousand
pities that he's so young, and so&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So poor?" I finished for her. "It is; a thousand
pities. But there is hope on ahead, my dear child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Billy will outgrow his infancy some time; and you
mustn't lose sight of the fact that, so far as poverty
and riches are concerned, we all look very much
alike, just now."</p>

<p>In such light-hearted banterings back and forth
we put the quarter-mile of beach behind us and
got busy with our smudge-fire building at the foot
of the stripped palm-tree which carried one of
Madeleine Barclay's knitted shoulder wraps for a
distress signal. With a few palmetto leaves and
bits of rotting wood to crisp and smoulder in the
blaze we soon had our smoke column erected; and
beyond this there was nothing much to do save to
scan the horizon for the hoped-for sail.</p>

<p>"Do you really believe we shall be taken off
before long, Dick Preble?" was Miss Edith's soberly
put query, this after the fire was well established,
and we were doing the horizon-sweeping
stunt.</p>

<p>"Do you want the bald truth, or some nice little
hopeful fiction?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You may save the fictions for Conetta and
Madeleine and Annette, if you please. As you
were kind enough to admit, a few minutes ago, I
am a woman grown."</p>

<p>"Then I shall tell you plainly, Edie. I know
this island. It is quite some distance from the
nearest of the steamer lanes. It may be a long time
before any one finds us."</p>

<p>She was silent for a little while, but the resolute,
girlish eyes were quite unterrified. When she spoke
again it was of a different matter.</p>

<p>"Dick," she began earnestly, "do you believe
there is anything more than foolishness at the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of all the talk we hear about a woman's intuition?"</p>

<p>"All sober-minded people admit that there is,
don't they?" I said.</p>

<p>"There is something behind all this that is happening
to us," she asserted gravely; "something
that I can feel, and can't grasp or understand. It
is as real to me as the breeze in those palms, or this
staring sunshine, and is as intangible as both."</p>

<p>"You have been talking with Conetta," I said
shortly.</p>

<p>"About this? No, I haven't. What makes you
say that?"</p>

<p>"No matter; go on with your intangibility."</p>

<p>"This sudden mutiny and the way it was hurled
at us: it is all so strange and unaccountable. Who
ever heard of the sailing-master of a private yacht
turning pirate? And especially a dear, cross old
Uncle Elijah, whose ancestors probably came over
in the <i>Mayflower?</i>"</p>

<p>"Is Bonteck saying that Goff headed the mutiny?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"He is letting the others say it, which is just the
same."</p>

<p>"As you say, it is fairly incredible. Yet the fact
remains. We are here, and the <i>Andromeda</i>, with
Goff on board, has vanished."</p>

<p>"I know; but the mystery isn't to be solved in
any such easy way as that. What possible use can
Uncle Elijah or his crew of Portuguese and mixed-bloods
make of the <i>Andromeda</i>, which is probably
known in every civilized harbor of the world as
Mr. Bonteck Van Dyck's private yacht?"</p>

<p>I hesitated to tell her the story of the treasure-carrying.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
That was Van Dyck's secret, so long as
he chose to make a secret of it.</p>

<p>"As to the object of the mutiny, we are all
entitled to a guess," I said. Then I offered one
which was plausible or not, as one chose to view
it: "Suppose we suppose that some one of the
Central or South American countries is on the edge
of a revolution; that isn't very hard to imagine,
is it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Very well. The sharpest need of the rebels in
any revolution is for arms and ammunition; next
to this, a fast ship to carry the arms and ammunition.
If there should happen to be money
enough in the revolutionary war-chest, isn't it conceivable
that even an Uncle Elijah might be
tempted?"</p>

<p>She turned and looked me squarely in the eye.</p>

<p>"Is that your guess, Dick Preble?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"It is as good as any, isn't it?" I replied evasively.</p>

<p>When she said: "It doesn't satisfy me; it is too
absurd," her repetition of Conetta's protest of the
previous night was almost startling.</p>

<p>"There are times when you women are almost
uncanny," I told her, but she merely laughed at
that.</p>

<p>"The absurdity isn't my only hunch," she went
on, after the frank-speaking manner of her kind.
"This Robinson Crusoe experience is going to be
a dreadful thing, in a way. There won't be any
illusions left for any of us, I'm afraid&mdash;any more
than there were for the people of the Stone Age."</p>

<p>That sage remark brought on more talk, and we
speculated cheerfully on the death of the illusions
and what might reasonably be expected as the results<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
thereof. My chatty companion had a lively
imagination, and her forecastings of the changes
that would ensue in the different members of our
colony were handsomely entertaining.</p>

<p>"And you," she said, when she had worked her
way around to me in the prophesying; "I can just
see what an unlivable person you will become."</p>

<p>"Why should I be so particularly unlivable?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"That awful temper of yours," she went on
baldly. "With all the civilized veneer cracked and
peeling off&mdash;my-oh!"</p>

<p>Now it is one thing to be well assured, in one's
own summings-up, of the possession of a violent
temper, and quite another to be told bluntly that
the possession is a commonly accepted fact among
one's friends and acquaintances. Edie Van Tromp's
assertion of the fact as one that had&mdash;or might
have been&mdash;published in the newspapers came with
a decided shock.</p>

<p>"Am I as bad as all that?" I protested.</p>

<p>"Everybody knows what a vile temper you have,"
she replied coolly. "Anybody who couldn't get
along with Conetta Kincaide without quarreling
with her&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh; so she has told you I have quarreled with
her?"</p>

<p>"There you go," she gibed. "One has only to
mention Conetta to you to touch off the powder
train. What makes you quarrel with her, Uncle
Dick?"</p>

<p>"What makes you think I am quarreling with
her?"</p>

<p>"Hoo! I've got eyes, I guess. Of course, you've
been decently polite to her, but a blind person could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
see that it was just put on. The veneer wasn't
cracked then. I shudder to think what will happen
when it gets all cracked and peelly."</p>

<p>I thought it was time for a diversion, so I turned
the tables upon her.</p>

<p>"How will it be with you after the veneer glue
lets go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, me?&mdash;I'm just a crude little brute, anyway.
I don't just see how I <i>could</i> change for the worse.
I'm saying this because I know it is what you are
thinking. But there's one comfort. Billy won't
see any difference in me, no matter what I do.
And Billy himself won't change; he's too obvious."</p>

<p>We prolonged our watch until nearly noon, when
the professor and his wife came out to relieve us.
It may say itself that during our two hours or more
of horizon-searching we saw no signs of a rescue
vessel. In the wide three-quarters of a circle visible
from the western point of the island&mdash;a point
where I had spent many weary hours after the
shipwreck of the <i>Mary Jane</i>&mdash;there had been only
the calm expanse of sea and sky with nothing to
break the monotony.</p>

<p>At the camp under the palms we found things
settling into some sort of routine. A fire was going
in the rude fire place built of rough chunks of the
coral, and Mrs. Van Tromp and her athletic eldest
were cooking dinner. The major and Holly Barclay
were still loafing on the beach, both of them
smoking as though we had a Tampa cigar factory to
draw upon instead of a strictly limited supply of
Van Dyck's "perfectos." Madeleine and Beatrice
Van Tromp, working together, were trying to
fashion a basket out of stripped palm fronds&mdash;though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
just what purpose a basket would serve
I couldn't imagine.</p>

<p>Billy Grisdale, suddenly become useful, was
gathering bits of wood for the cooking fire. Jack
Grey, who, besides being a rising young attorney,
had a flair for building things, was adding to the
thatch of the dunnage shelter, and Annette was
helping him. Ingerson was invisible, and so was
Van Dyck. Miss Mehitable, whose health may or
may not have been all that it should be, was lying
in her hammock, and Conetta, ever dutiful, was
fanning her with a broad palmetto leaf. Among
the workers it was Jerry Dupuyster who appeared
in the most original rôle. In the nattiest of one-piece
bathing suits&mdash;supplied, as I made no doubt,
out of the luggage of one of the Van Tromp girls&mdash;he
had swum the lagoon to the wreck of the <i>Mary
Jane</i>, where he now appeared, a symphony in cerise
stripes and bare legs, hacking manfully at the wreck
with a hand-axe to the end that we might increase
our scanty stock of firewood.</p>

<p>After the noon meal, at which Van Dyck appeared
just as we were sitting down to it, Jerry and I were
told off to go on sentry duty at the eastern end of
the island, where we were to establish another
distress signal.</p>

<p>"Us for the sentry-go, old chappie," said Jerry
cheerfully, and together we took the beach trail for
our post.</p>

<p>Reaching the eastern extremity of things after
a walk of perhaps three-quarters of a mile along the
beach, we presently had an improvised flag flying
from a lopped tree, and after we had lighted a
smoke smudge there was nothing more to do but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to watch for the sail which I, for one, did not
expect to see.</p>

<p>"Jolly rum old go, what?" said Jerry, casting
himself full length upon the sand when our labors
were ended. "Shouldn't mind it so much, don't
y' know, if we didn't have the women along.
Smoke?" and he handed me his tobacco bag.</p>

<p>"The women, and one or two others," I qualified,
filling my pipe.</p>

<p>"Haw, yes: Hob Ingerson, for one. Actin' like
a bally cad, Ingerson is. Needs to have some
chappie give him a wallop or so, what?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and when it comes to the show-down,
I rather hope I'll be the 'chappie'," I said.</p>

<p>"Not if I see him first," Jerry cut in, and this,
indeed, was a new development.</p>

<p>"You're under weight, Jerry; you wouldn't make
two bites for Ingerson if you should try to mix it
with him."</p>

<p>"Eh, what?" exclaimed the transformed&mdash;or
transforming&mdash;one, sitting up suddenly. "If he
doesn't stop his dashed swearin' before the women,
I'll take him on; believe me, I will, old dear."</p>

<p>"What makes you think you'd last out the first
half of the first round with a big bully like Ingerson?"
I asked, grinning at him.</p>

<p>"Number of little things, old top; this, for one,"
and he opened his shirt to show me something
that looked like a ten-dollar gold piece suspended
by a silken cord around his neck.</p>

<p>"And what might that be?" I inquired, mildly
curious.</p>

<p>He pulled the string off over his head and handed
me the gold disk. It proved to be a medal, struck
by some gentlemen's boxing club of London, testifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to the facts that Mr. Gerald Dupuyster was
a member in good standing, and that he had won
the medal by reason of his being the top-notcher in
the club's series of light-weight matches.</p>

<p>"I never would have suspected it of you, Jerry,"
I commented, returning the medal. "In fact, I
should have said you were the last person on earth
to go in for the manly art of self-defense. What
made you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!&mdash;all the chappies with any red blood
in 'em go in for it over there, y' know. Jolly good
sport, too; what?"</p>

<p>"Here's to you, if you conclude to try it on with
Ingerson," I laughed. "I'll be your towel-holder.
But Ingerson isn't the only one we could do without
on this right little tight little island of ours, Jerry."</p>

<p>"You're dashed right. There's Barclay, for
another."</p>

<p>"Yes; and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say it, old dear. Don't I know that the old
uncle is cuttin' up rusty? Grousing because he
can't sit in an easy-chair and swig toddies no end!
Makes me jolly well ashamed, he does."</p>

<p>Here was another astonishing revelation. From
what I had seen on shipboard&mdash;from what we had
all seen&mdash;there had been ample grounds for the
supposition that Jerry was a mere pawn in any
game his uncle might choose to play. But now
there seemed to be quite a different Jerry lying
just under the cracking crust of the conventions.
The discovery took a bit of the bitterness out of
my soul. If I couldn't have Conetta for myself, it
was a distinct comfort to know that she wasn't
going to draw a complete blank in the great lottery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Under all of Jerry's Anglomaniacal fripperies there
was apparently a man.</p>

<p>At the refilling of his pipe this changed, or
changing, Jerry spoke of my former immurement
on the island, saying that Conetta had told him
a bit about it, and asking if I wouldn't tell him a
bit more. So once again I told the story of the
ill-fated voyage of the <i>Mary Jane</i> and its near-tragic
sequel for six poor castaways.</p>

<p>"Rummy old go, that," he commented, when the
tale was told. "Dashed easy to see how a chap
might lose out on all the little decencies when the
belly-pinch takes hold. Are we likely to come a
cropper into that ditch before some bally old tub
turns up to take us off?"</p>

<p>"I'm hoping not," I said.</p>

<p>He was silent for a time, and when he spoke again
it was to say: "We've eighteen mouths to fill, old
dear; how long can we fill 'em out of the blooming
tins; eh? what?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. "Van Dyck and I checked
the provisions over this morning while we were
storing them. We shall do well enough for two or
three weeks; maybe longer, if we're careful not to
waste any of the food."</p>

<p>At this my fellow watcher swore roundly in good,
plain American.</p>

<p>"Saw Holly Barclay turn up his damned nose
and pitch his ship's biscuits into the lagoon this
morning," he explained. "Said something about
their not bein' fit for a human being to eat, by Jove!"</p>

<p>"He'll sing another tune if we have to come down
to cocoanuts and sea worms," I prophesied. Even
this early in the game it was plainly evident that
Barclay, the major, and Hobart Ingerson were going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to be our sorest afflictions when the pinch should
come.</p>

<p>In such fashion we wore out the afternoon, blinding
our eyes, as I had many times blinded mine in
other days, with fruitless searchings of the unresponsive
waste of waters. At dusk we built up the
signal fire to make it last as long as possible and
returned to the camp at the other end of the island.
When we came in sight of it, Mrs. Van Tromp and
two of her girls were putting the supper for the
eighteen of us on a clean tarpaulin spread upon the
beach. Van Dyck met us just before we joined the
others.</p>

<p>"Nothing?" he queried.</p>

<p>"Nothing," we answered.</p>

<p>And the evening and the morning were the first
day.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>




<h2>IX<br />
<br />
<small>THE BULLY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> remark of Edith Van Tromp's, to the effect
that the illusions would all be swept away, had its
confirmation before we had tholed through the first
week of our island captivity. Little by little the
masks slipped aside, and some of the revealments
of the true character hiding behind them&mdash;some of
the revelations, but not all&mdash;were grimly illuminating.</p>

<p>Before the week's end I saw the major slyly slip
the last box of the precious cigars under his coat
when he thought no one was looking and go off to
hide it in a shallow hole scooped in the dry sand of
the beach edge at a safe distance from the camp.
Later, I came upon him as he was burying a couple
of bottles of the diminishing supply of liquor in the
same place&mdash;and he lied to me and said he was
digging for shell-fish.</p>

<p>Two or three days earlier than this, Holly Barclay
had taken to his hammock bed in a fit of purely
imaginary illness, exacting constant attendance and
pampering in which he made a toiling slave of his
pretty daughter. When the pampering began and
continued with no sign of abatement in the querulous
demands Barclay was making upon Madeleine,
Van Dyck grew gloomy and snappish, and
I knew that the day was only postponing itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
when Bonteck would flame out at the sham invalid
and tell him exactly and precisely what a selfish
malingerer he was.</p>

<p>Still lower in the unmasking scale came Ingerson&mdash;the
real Ingerson&mdash;who had lapsed into a sullen
barbarian; unshaven, unbathed, and with the
coarse warp and woof of him showing at every
threadbare seam. What time he had free access
to the liquor, he drank himself ugly at least once
in every twenty-four hours; and when Mrs. Van
Tromp finally shamed him out of his daylight
attacks upon the liquor chest, he took to raiding it
after the camp was asleep, keeping this up until one
night when he found that the remainder of the
bottled stuff had disappeared. After this he became
a morose threat to everybody, and even Mrs.
Van Tromp ignored his millions and turned a cold
shoulder upon him.</p>

<p>Three nights after his unsuccessful effort to turn
up another bottle of whiskey in the stores, the
drink maniac tried it again, and this time Van Dyck
awoke and caught him at it.</p>

<p>"Looking for something you haven't lost, Ingerson?"
he said, speaking quietly to keep from
disturbing the others.</p>

<p>Ingerson backed out of the palmetto-thatched
store shelter and whirled upon Van Dyck with a
face which, as the firelight showed it to me, was
that of a devil denied.</p>

<p>"Where have you hid it?" he demanded hoarsely.
"Tell me, or I'll wring your damned neck!"</p>

<p>Van Dyck's smile was almost as devilish as
Ingerson's teeth-baring snarl.</p>

<p>"You needn't make a racket and wake the camp,"
he said in the evenest of tones. "I did hide it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and it was partly to give you a decently fair chance.
Come with me." And he got up and the pair of
them disappeared among the palms.</p>

<p>Not trusting Ingerson any more than I would
have trusted a snake, I rose silently and followed
them into the shadows, coming in sight of them
again as they entered a little open glade on the
opposite side of the island. Ingerson had halted
and was gesticulating angrily.</p>

<p>"I want to know here and now what you meant
by that 'decent chance' break you made at me!"
he was saying. "If you mean Madge Barclay, I
can tell you right off the bat that you're a dead
one!"</p>

<p>"We will leave Miss Barclay quite out of it, if
you please," said Bonteck, still apparently as cool
as Ingerson was hot. "You want liquor, and I've
brought you here to give it to you."</p>

<p>"We'll settle that other little thing first," Ingerson
broke in truculently. "You put up this
winter cruise, that you've bungled and turned into
a starvation picnic, with the notion that you were
going to corner the market for yourself, I suppose.
I'm here to tell you that you lose out. Barclay
makes this deal without any brokers, and I hold
an option on him."</p>

<p>"You will have to make that part of it a little
plainer, I'm afraid," said Van Dyck; and now there
was a dangerous softness in his voice.</p>

<p>"You can have it straight, if you want it that
way. Barclay's in a hole for money; he's always in
a hole. I've agreed to pay him out, once for all,
and he's accepted the bid."</p>

<p>"And the price?" queried Bonteck gently&mdash;very
gently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can ask Madge about that," was the surly
rejoinder. And then: "Get a move: where have
you hid that whiskey?"</p>

<p>"You shall have the whiskey presently, Ingerson;
but first I'm going to give you something you've
been needing a good bit worse for a long time.
Put up your hands, if you know how!"</p>

<p>It was a very pretty fight, out there in the moonlit
glade, with the camp far enough removed to
make the privacy of it safe, and with no ring-side
audience, so far as either of the combatants knew,
to hiss or applaud. Ingerson was no coward,
neither was he lacking in bull strength, nor in the
skill to make fairly good use of it. Though he
went in at the beginning with a handicap of blind
rage, the first few passes steadied him and for a
minute or so it looked as if Bonteck had taken on
a full load.</p>

<p>But, as a very ordinary prophet might have foretold,
Ingerson's late prolonged soak&mdash;for it was
nothing less&mdash;presently got in its work. Twice
Van Dyck landed swinging body blows; and though
neither of these would have winded a sober man,
the second left Ingerson gasping and with his jaw
hanging. I thought that settled it, and it did,
practically, though the bully was still game.
Handling himself as coolly as if he were giving a
boxing lesson on a gymnasium floor, Van Dyck
landed again and again, and each blow was sent
home with an impact that sounded like the kick
of a mule.</p>

<p>Ingerson stood up to it as long as he could, and
when his wind was gone he went into a clinch.
Bonteck broke the clinch with a volley of short-arm
jabs that was little less than murderous, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
when he was hammered out of the clinch, Ingerson
staggered and went down. I looked to see him
stay down, but he didn't. After a moment of
breath-catching he was up and at it again, and it
took three more of the well-planted body blows to
drive him into a second clinch. As before, he failed
to pinion Van Dyck's right arm, and I made sure
he tried to set his teeth in Van Dyck's shoulder.</p>

<p>At this, Bonteck shifted his short-arm jabs from
the ribs and swung upon the unguarded jaw; whereupon
Ingerson lost his grip and curled up on the
ground like some huge worm that had been stepped
on.</p>

<p>Van Dyck stood over him, breathing hard.</p>

<p>"Have you had enough?" he demanded; and
when the vanquished one made some sort of grunting
acknowledgment, Bonteck brought water from
the near-by spring in a folded leaf of a giant begonia
and held it while Ingerson struggled to his knees
and bathed the battered jaw.</p>

<p>"Now I'll get you your whiskey," said Van Dyck
shortly; and leaving Ingerson to dabble his hands
in the cooling water, he went aside into the jungle,
returning after a minute or so with a case-bottle.
"Here you are," he said, giving the bottle to the
beaten bully; "take it and make a brute of yourself,
if that's what you want to do." And then I had
to hurry to be before Bonteck in the camp clearing;
to be in my place beside the handful of night fire
before he should return and catch me out of it.
For I had no notion of marring the perfect joy of
victory which I knew must be filling his soul.</p>

<p>After this there were other days merging slowly
into weeks; days of back-slippings into deeper
depths of the primitive, a retrogradation in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
we all participated more or less; days in which we
stolidly maintained the signal fires at either extremity
of the island and wore out the dragging
hours as best we could, scanning the horizon for the
coming sail of rescue, though each succeeding day
with less hope of seeing it, I think.</p>

<p>More and more markedly the conventions withdrew
into a past which was daily growing to seem
more like life in a former avatar than a reality
once ours to possess. From merely slipping aside
now and again, the masks were carelessly dropped
and suffered to remain where they fell. Seen in
the new perspective, there were many surprising
changes, and not all of them were disappointing.
For example: Mrs. Eager Van Tromp, in her
normal state a good lady driven to distraction by
her efforts to hold her footing on the social ladder
and so to marry her daughters adequately, became,
<i>en séquestre</i>, the good-natured, plain-spoken mother
of us all, and a past mistress in the fine art of camp
cooking&mdash;a specialty in which she was ably seconded
by all three of her daughters, also, when she would
permit it, by Mrs. Sanford, Annette Grey and
Conetta.</p>

<p>Courageous fortitude best describes the change
that had come over Madeleine Barclay. With her
irritable father to placate and wait upon, and with
Ingerson's attitude toward her coming to be that
of blunt possessorship, she was by turns the patient
nurse to the malingerer and the cheerful heartener
of the rest of us. Never, in all those depressing
days of hope deferred, did I hear her complain;
and always she had a steadying word for the
despairing ones: if a ship didn't come for us to-day,
it would come to-morrow, and into the most dejected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
she could put new life&mdash;for the moment, at
least.</p>

<p>In John Grey and Annette, and in the professor
and his wife, the changes were the least marked.
For the newly married couple nothing much seemed
to matter so long as they had each other. Once
or twice, indeed, I surprised Grey with a look in
his eyes that told of the dread undercurrent that
must have been underlying his every thought of
the future and what it might hold for Annette, but
that was all. And as for the older couple&mdash;well,
perhaps they had attained to a higher and serener
plane than any to which we younger ones could
climb. Day in and day out, when he was not
doing his apportioned share of the common camp
tasks, the professor was immersed to the eyes in
a study of the lush flora of the island, thumbing
a little pocket Botany until its leaves were worn
and frayed with much turning. And where he
wandered, his wife wandered with him.</p>

<p>In Miss Mehitable, too, a transformation of a
sort was wrought. For many days she held sourly
aloof and had bitter words for Van Dyck, and black
looks for me when by any chance I was able to
deprive her for a time, long or short, of Conetta's
caretaking and coddling. But with the lapse of
time I fancied that even this crabbed lady was beginning
to lose her sense of the mere money distinctions,
and I was rash enough to say as much to
Conetta on a day when I was so fortunate as to
secure her for a companion in the signal-fire watch
which Bonteck still made us maintain.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't say such things about poor Aunt
Mehitable," was the reproof I got. "This is a very
terrible experience for her&mdash;as it would be for any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
woman of her age&mdash;and she is really more than
half sick."</p>

<p>"Don't mistake me," I made haste to say. "I
meant it wholly in a congratulatory sense."</p>

<p>"She has changed," Conetta admitted, adding:
"But dear me! we have all changed."</p>

<p>"'All the world's queer, excepting thee and me,
and sometimes even thee's a little queer'," I quoted.
"What changes have you remarked&mdash;particularly?"</p>

<p>"For one, Major Terwilliger is just a selfish,
peevish old man, utterly impossible to live with,"
she said calmly.</p>

<p>"Amen to that. Yet, one of these days you will
probably have to reckon with him as a member of
your household. Go on."</p>

<p>She went on, paying no attention to what I had
said about householding the major.</p>

<p>"The professor is a dear, just as you'd expect
him to be, and so is Mrs. Professor. Annette is as
brave as brave, and the way she is keeping up is
only equaled by Jack's adorable care of her, which
is at the bottom of his constant breezy assurances
that each day will be the last of our Crusoeing."</p>

<p>"And Billy?" I prompted.</p>

<p>"Billy is a dear, too. He has changed less than
any one, I think. Yesterday, at supper-time, he
nearly broke my heart. Perhaps you remember
that he got up and went away while we were eating,
saying that he'd forgotten something. A few
minutes later I went back to the spring to get some
fresh water for Aunt Mehitable and found him
sharing his supper with Tige. He'd heard what
Major Terwilliger had said about our wasting food
on the dog when we'd probably need it ourselves.
Wouldn't that make you weep?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"The dog is much more worthy of his rations
than the major is of what he consumes," I averred.
"Tige is at least willing to do his best if anybody
will show him how. Any more transmogrifications?"</p>

<p>"Lots of them. Possibly you've noticed that
Mrs. Van Tromp no longer tries to shoo Billy away
from Edie. That's a miracle in itself. Then there
is Madeleine: I have always thought her rather&mdash;um&mdash;well,
you know; rather stand-offish and maybe
a bit self-centered. Dick, she is an angel! The
way she devotes herself, body and soul, to that
father of hers, and still finds time and the heart to
chirk the rest of us up, is beyond all praise."</p>

<p>"You can't get a quarrel out of me on that
score," I returned. "Madeleine is all that you say
she is, and more. As for her father, I guess we
can pass him up. Between us two, he is no more
sick than I am. And I don't believe he has changed
a particle; we are merely coming to know him
better as he really is, and always has been."</p>

<p>"I have known him for a long time," Conetta
said thoughtfully. Then she agreed with me:
"We'll leave him out; he cancels himself on the
minus side of the equation, as you used to say of
certain people we knew in the old days at home."</p>

<p>I wasn't half sure enough of myself to be willing
to have her drag in the old days, so I urged her to
go on with her cataloguing of our fellow castaways,
saying: "You haven't completed the list yet."</p>

<p>"There is one more to be omitted&mdash;Hobart Ingerson,"
she said soberly, with a shadow of deep disgust
coming into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Will Madeleine omit him?" I asked quickly.</p>

<p>"If she doesn't&mdash;after what we've been compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to see and feel and endure! Dick, it's dreadful;
simply dreadful!"</p>

<p>"Yet she will marry him," I insisted&mdash;purely to
hear what my companion would say to that.</p>

<p>"It is unbelievable. What possible motive could
she have in doing such an unspeakable thing?"</p>

<p>"A few minutes ago you called her an angel;
perhaps it will be the angelic motive. Her father
needs money; needs a very considerable sum of
money, and needs it badly. She knows of the need&mdash;though
I think she doesn't know the immediate
and exciting cause of it&mdash;and she also knows that
Ingerson is willing to buy and pay."</p>

<p>"How perfectly horrible!" said my watchmate,
with a shudder. And then: "What a pity it is
that Madeleine's money was all swallowed up in
that bank failure out West."</p>

<p>I smiled when she said that. Madeleine's fortune
hadn't gone in any bank failure, neither out West
nor back East. This was only another of Holly
Barclay's plausible little fictions.</p>

<p>"You mean?&mdash;" I suggested.</p>

<p>"I mean that if she had money of her own she
might buy her freedom. I imagine it is purely a
financial matter with Mr. Holly Barclay. If she
could only find some of the Spaniards' gold&mdash;find
it for herself so that it would belong to her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Wouldn't that be splendid!"</p>

<p>This was something entirely new to me, and I
said: "What gold is this you are talking about?"</p>

<p>She looked around at me with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;haven't you heard?" Then: "Oh, I
remember; Bonteck was telling us the story last
evening, while you and the professor were out at
the other signal fire." And thereupon she repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the old tale of the siege and wreck of the Spanish
galleon in Queen Elizabeth's reign, with the tradition
of the hidden treasure whose hiding place the
survivors had refused to betray&mdash;paying for their
refusal with their lives.</p>

<p>"Of course, that is only a sea yarn&mdash;one of the
many that are told about those old days and the
doings in them," was my comment. "You knew
that while you were listening to it, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I supposed it wasn't true. I kept
telling myself that Bonteck was only trying to
start some new interest that would keep us from
going stark mad over this wretched imprisonment,
and the watching and waiting that never amounts
to anything. It's serving a purpose, too. Most of
the young ones are turning treasure hunters&mdash;going
in couples. Jerry Dupuyster was trying to persuade
Beatrice to slip away just as we left the camp. I
heard him."</p>

<p>That small reference to Jerry and his disloyalty&mdash;which
was becoming daily more and more apparent,
and which I may have omitted to mention&mdash;moved
me as one of the Yellowstone Park geysers is said
to be moved by the dropping into it of a bar of
soap.</p>

<p>"One of these fine days I'm going to beat Jerry
Dupuyster until his best friend wouldn't recognize
him," I said savagely.</p>

<p>Conetta laughed; the silvery little laugh that I
was once besotted enough to believe that she kept
especially for me.</p>

<p>"There goes your temper again. That is one
thing that hasn't changed," she said. And then:
"Poor Jerry! You'd have to have one hand tied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
behind you, wouldn't you?&mdash;just to be reasonably
fair, you know."</p>

<p>There had been a time when I should have admitted
that her gibe hit the mark, but that was
before the transformed&mdash;or transforming&mdash;Jerry
had been revealed to me.</p>

<p>"Nothing like that," I said. "He may not have
confided it to you, but Jerry is a man of his hands.
Hasn't he ever shown you the medal he won in
England?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. "There are lots of things
Jerry hasn't shown me&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>"Well, he has the medal, and it says he was the
top-notcher in his class in some London boxing club.
I give him credit for that; but just the same, there
have been times during the past few days when I've
had a curious longing to see how near I could come
to throwing him bodily across the lagoon."</p>

<p>Again she said, "Poor Jerry!" and had the calm
assurance to ask me what he had done to incur my
ill will.</p>

<p>"Done!" I exclaimed. "What hasn't he done?
If he thinks he is going to be allowed to play fast
and loose with you for a chit of a girl like Beatrice
Van Tromp&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Once more her silvery laugh interrupted.</p>

<p>"Beatrice will be twenty-three on her next birthday.
She is quite well able to fight her own battles,
Mr. Dickie Preble."</p>

<p>"Oh, confound it all; you know what I mean!"
I fumed hotly. "He has asked you to marry him,
hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"He has," she replied quite calmly.</p>

<p>"Well, isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," she said. "You must try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
control that dreadful temper of yours. You're
miles too touchy, Dickie, dear."</p>

<p>That remark was so true that I was constrained
to wrench the talk aside from Jerry and the temperamental
things by main strength.</p>

<p>"This treasure-hunting business," I said. "I'm
wondering if that is what Bonteck has had on his
mind? He has been acting like a man half out of
his senses for the past few days. Surely you have
noticed it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I've been setting it down as one of the
most remarkable of the changes we have been talking
about. You know how he was at first; he
seemed to take everything as a matter of course,
and was able to calm everybody's worries. But
lately, as you say, he has been acting like a man
with an unconfessed murder on his soul. I was so
glad when he told us that galleon story last night.
He was more like himself."</p>

<p>"He feels his responsibility, naturally," I suggested,
"and it grows heavier the longer we are
shut up here. While I think very few of us blame
him personally for what has happened to us, he
can't help feeling that if he hadn't planned the
cruise and invited us, the thing wouldn't have
happened at all."</p>

<p>"Of course; anybody would feel that way," she
agreed, and after that she fell silent.</p>

<p>The weather on this day of our morning watch
under the western palm-tree signal staff was much
like that of all the other days; superlatively fine,
and with the sun's warmth delightfully tempered
by the steady fanning of the breeze which was
tossing miniature breakers over the comb of the
outer reef. Conetta's gaze was fixed upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
distant horizon, and when I looked around I saw
that her eyes were slowly filling with tears.</p>

<p>We had been comrades as well as lovers in the
old days; which was possibly why I took her hand
and held it, and why she did not resent the new-old caress.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," I urged. "You used to be
able to lean upon me once, Conetta, dear."</p>

<p>"It's just the&mdash;the loneliness, Dick," she faltered,
squeezing the tears back. "We've all been dropping
the masks and showing what we really are;
but there is one mask that we never drop&mdash;any of
us. We laugh and joke, and tell one another that
to-morrow, or the next day at the very farthest, will
see the end of this jolly picnic on Pirates' Hope.
But really, in the bottom of our hearts, we know
that it may never end&mdash;only with our lives. Isn't
that so?"</p>

<p>I did not dare tell her the bald truth; that it
might, indeed, come to a life-and-death struggle
with starvation before our slender chance of rescue
should materialize.</p>

<p>"I don't allow myself to think of that," I said
quickly&mdash;and it was a lie out of the whole cloth.
"And you mustn't let your small anchor drag, either,
Connie, girl."</p>

<p>"I know; but I can't help hearing&mdash;and seeing.
This morning early, before most of them were up,
I saw Billy and Jack Grey trying to make some
fishing lines and hooks; they were jollying each
other about the fun they were going to have whipping
the lagoon for a change of diet for us. And
yesterday I happened to overhear the professor
telling Bonteck that he had made a careful search
of the island for the edible roots that grow wild in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the tropics, and hadn't been able to find any.
Naturally, I knew at once what these things meant.
The provisions are running low."</p>

<p>I nodded. It didn't seem worth while to try to
lie to her.</p>

<p>"How far has it spread?" I asked. "Mrs. Van
Tromp has been trying to keep the scarcity in the
background. Does any one else know?"</p>

<p>"I can't say. But I do know that Mrs. Van
Tromp is anxious to hide it from her girls&mdash;and
from Madeleine."</p>

<p>"Why from Madeleine in particular?"</p>

<p>Again Conetta let her honest eyes look fairly into
mine.</p>

<p>"Because Bonteck will not have Madeleine told.
He means to spare her to the very last, no matter
how much she has to waste upon her father's
finicky appetite. Only this morning, she had to
throw his entire breakfast away&mdash;after he'd messed
with it and spoiled it&mdash;and get him another one!"</p>

<p>This was growing serious; much more serious than
I had suspected; and I made a mental resolve to
get the men of our party together on a short-rations
basis at once. We had been hideously
reckless with our stores; no one could deny that.</p>

<p>"This smudge will smoke for an hour or so
longer," I pointed out, rising and helping Conetta
to her feet. "Suppose we take a walk around on
the south beach and look over toward my old
stamping ground in Venezuela."</p>

<p>She made no objection, and once we were in
motion we kept on, since the southern horizon was
just as likely to yield the hopeful sign for which we
were straining our eyes as any other. I am morally
certain that I had no hunch to prompt the change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of view-point, and if my companion had, she didn't
mention it. Nevertheless, when we had measured
something less than half the length of the island,
tramping side by side in sober silence over the white
sands, the thing we had looked for in vain through
so many weary hours appeared, and we both saw
it at the same instant&mdash;the long, low smoke trail of
a steamer blackening the line where sea and sky
came together.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done; absolutely nothing
that we could do to attract the attention of those
people who were just out of sight below the blurred
horizon. For so long as we could distinguish the
slowly vanishing harbinger of rescue we stood transfixed,
hardly daring to breathe, hoping against hope
that the steamer's course was laid toward us instead
of away from us. But when the black of the smoke
trail had faded to gray, and the gray became so
faint that it was no longer separable from the slight
haze of the sky-line, Conetta turned and clung to
me, sobbing like a hurt and frightened child. It
was too much, and I took her in my arms and
comforted her, as I had once had the right to do.</p>

<p>And at that climaxing moment, out of the jungle
thicketing behind us came Jerry Dupuyster and
Beatrice Van Tromp. Beatrice was laughing openly,
and on Jerry's face there was an inane smile
that made me wish very heartily to kill him where
he stood.</p>

<h2>X<br />
<br />
<small>THE BONES OF THE "SANTA LUCIA."</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Conetta's</span> assertion, made in half-confidence to
me, to the effect that Bonteck's attitude had
changed, had ample backgrounding in the fact, and
the cause&mdash;at least, so it appeared to me&mdash;was a
sharp and growing anxiety.</p>

<p>Time and again I had surprised him sweeping
the horizon with the field-glass, which was the only
thing he had taken from his cabin stateroom when
Lequat had come for us; and while there was nothing
especially remarkable about this, I remembered that
he had heretofore been turning this duty carelessly
over to the various watchers at the signal fires. To
be sure, the diminishing supply of eatables was a
sufficient cause for any amount of anxiety, but I
could not help thinking that there was something
even bigger than the prospective food shortage
gnawing at him. And that conclusion was confirmed
on the day after Conetta and I had seen the
steamer smoke, when I came upon him sitting on
the beach at the farthest extremity of the island,
with his head in his hands&mdash;a picture of the deepest
dejection.</p>

<p>But with all this, he was still unremitting in his
efforts to keep us from stagnating and slipping into
that pit of despair which always yawns for the
shipwrecked castaway. His revival of the legendary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
tale of the old Spanish plate ship, with its sequel
of the starving crew and the buried treasure, was
one of the expedients; and though gold was the one
thing for which our marooned ship's company had
the least possible use, the story served an excellent
purpose.</p>

<p>Treasure-trove became, as one might say, the
stock joke of the moment. Even the Sanfords went
strolling about the island, prodding with sticks in
the soft sand and turning up the fallen leaves in
the wood; and Grey proposed jocularly that we
stake off the beach in the vicinity of the skeleton
wreck of the old galleon and fall to digging systematically,
each on his own mining claim.</p>

<p>It was while this treasure-hunting diversion was
holding the center of the stage that a thing I had
been anticipating came to pass. Van Dyck suddenly
broke over the host-and-guest barriers and
read the riot act to Holly Barclay. I happened to
be within earshot at the cataclysmic moment&mdash;it
was one of the rare moments when Madeleine
wasn't dancing attendance upon the sham invalid&mdash;and
what Van Dyck said to Barclay was quite
enough, I thought, to kill any possible chance he
might have had as a suitor, with a father who stood
ready to purchase immunity from just punishment
at the price of his daughter's happiness.</p>

<p>"You are acting like a spoiled child, Barclay;
that is the plain English of it," was Bonteck's blunt
charge. "You are not sick, and if you were, it
would be no excuse for the way you are tying your
daughter down. Hereafter there will be a new deal.
Madeleine must have some time every day for exercise
and recreation."</p>

<p>"She won't take it," retorted the malingerer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"She will if you tell her to; and you are going to
insist upon it."</p>

<p>"I won't be bullied by you, Bonteck Van Dyck!
You haven't anything to say&mdash;after the way you've
let us in for this hellish nightmare. What business
is it of yours if Madge chooses to make things a little
less unbearable for me?"</p>

<p>"I am making it my business, and what I say
goes as it lies. You turn Madeleine loose for her
bit of freedom mornings and evenings. If you
don't, I shall tell her what I know about her cousin's
fortune, and what you have done with it."</p>

<p>Barclay crumpled up like a man hit in the stomach
by a soft-nosed bullet, and the faded pink in his
cheeks turned to a sickly copper yellow.</p>

<p>"Don't!" he gasped. "For God's sake, don't do
that, Van Dyck! She may go&mdash;I'll make her go.
I&mdash;I'm a sick man, I tell you, and you're trying to
kill me! Go away and let me alone!"</p>

<p>Van Dyck came out of the palm clump where
Barclay's hammock was swung&mdash;and found me
eavesdropping.</p>

<p>"That was a piker's trick&mdash;listening in on me,
Dick," he remonstrated half-impatiently. But,
after all, I think he was glad he had a witness to
Barclay's promise.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, Madeleine got her freedom,
or some measure of it, immediately. It was Alicia
Van Tromp who told me that a miracle had been
wrought.</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Holly Barclay must be near his
end," she said, with fine scorn. "He is insisting
that Madeleine go for a walk. Wouldn't that
shock you?"</p>

<p>When Madeleine made her appearance, I looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to see Bonteck monopolize her, as he had earned
the right to do; but what he did was to thrust me
into the breach.</p>

<p>"You heard what I said to Holly Barclay and
you know why I said it," was the way he put it up
to me. "Madeleine hasn't been out of shouting
distance of her father's hammock half a dozen times
since the night we were marooned. Trot her all
around the shop and make her think of something
different. I'll square things for you with Conetta."</p>

<p>"You are about three years too late to square me
with Conetta," I said sourly. "Have you anything
else up your sleeve?"</p>

<p>"Several things; but I'm not going to show them
to you just now. Be a good sport and help me
out. I'd do as much for you, any day; in fact, I've
done a good bit more as it is, if you only knew it.
Here she comes; don't let Ingerson get in ahead of
you. Take her around the south beach and come
back the other way. Jump for it, you crabbed old
woman-hater! It isn't every day in the week that
you have such a privilege jammed down your
throat."</p>

<p>It was no very difficult task&mdash;the capturing of
Madeleine. She fell in promptly and amiably with
my suggestion that we go on an exploring tramp
around the beach line of the island, and I took her
the roundabout way, as Bonteck had directed, to
make her release last as long as possible.</p>

<p>I don't recall what we talked about at first, only
I know that it was all perfectly innocuous. We
had common ground enough&mdash;the people we both
knew at home, a summer fortnight on the North
Shore when she was a débutante and we were fellow
guests in the same house group, a winter tour in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
California when we had both chanced to be members
of the same party. But inevitably, and in spite of
all I could do to turn it aside, the talk eventually
drifted around to the present with its more than
dubious possibilities.</p>

<p>"Conetta tells me that you were once ship-wrecked
on this same bit of coral, Dick," was the
way she switched from the North Shore house
party to Pirates' Hope. "Doesn't it seem a most
remarkable coincidence that you should have the
misfortune to have to repeat that experience?"</p>

<p>"Compared with the other experience, this is a
vacation pleasure camp," I said, trying to keep the
serious aspect of things in the background. "We
came ashore in a hurricane, the six of us who were
not drowned, and had to live on cocoanuts and
raw fish. We hadn't even the makings of a fire."</p>

<p>"How dreadful it must have been!" she exclaimed.
"I should think that the memory of that
terrible time would color every minute of the day
for you now, with all the reminders there must be."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," I denied cheerfully. "'The
mill doesn't grind with the water that has passed,'
you know. And, besides, the <i>Mary Jane's</i> survivors
were taken off in due time&mdash;which we may
take as an earnest that we shall be picked up,
sooner or later."</p>

<p>We had reached the extreme eastern point of the
islet by this time, and she stopped and faced me.</p>

<p>"Are you really believing that, Dick?" she asked,
with a little trembling of the pretty lips that she
could not wholly control, though a blind man might
have seen that she was trying to, hard enough.</p>

<p>"Of course I am."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you wouldn't admit it to me if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
weren't. You see, I can't forget that those others
stayed here and starved&mdash;long ago, you know&mdash;the
crew of the <i>Santa Lucia</i>."</p>

<p>"You have been listening to Bonteck's ghost
stories," I jested. "You mustn't take them for
matters of fact."</p>

<p>"But there <i>is</i> a wreck," she insisted; "I mean
besides the one on the reef opposite our camp."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; there is a bare suggestion of an older
wreck," I said. "We'll go and have a look at it,
if you like. It's on the north beach, and we can
go back that way. Would you care to see it?"</p>

<p>She nodded, and we strolled on in sober silence
for another half-mile. I was afraid I was not
making much of a success of the job of keeping her
spirits up, and was beginning to wish very heartily
that I had made Bonteck do his own jollying.
Just why she should be looking upon the blue side
of things at last, after she had been the one to do
most of the cheering in the past, I couldn't imagine
at first, but a bit later the solution&mdash;or a possible
solution&mdash;came to me. Perhaps the invalid, knowing
that he was going to lose some of his hold upon
her through Van Dyck's insistence upon more freedom
for her, had been pressing the Ingerson claim
still harder.</p>

<p>The wreck of the galleon&mdash;if, indeed, the few bits
of barnacled timber and rusting ironwork could, by
any stretch of imagination, be dated back to a
period so remote as that of the conquest of Peru&mdash;was
in the bight of a little bay, well sheltered by the
tallest of the palms, which effectually screened it
from our camp end of the island. It wanted possibly
half an hour of sunset when we came upon the
few dumb relics, and the shadows of the palms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
were making weird traceries upon the white sand
of the beach.</p>

<p>Assuming that the largest of the charred and
blackened "bones" was the stem of the ancient
wreck, it was to be inferred that the ship had
entered the lagoon bay through the seaward opening
in the outer reef, had been beached bows on, and
had so lain and burned, or rotted. Assuming,
again, that the vessel had really been one of the
old, high-bowed galleons, it was apparent that the
beaching had been done with considerable force;
a drive so hard that the bowsprit of the ship must
have been thrust like a huge pointing finger into
the jungle thicketing, which, at this point, ran well
down to the edge of the lagoon.</p>

<p>It was Van Dyck who made this hypothetical
platting of the beaching of the vessel for us; Bonteck
himself, who had slipped ghost-like out of the palm
shadows to join us while we were trying to trace
the skeleton outline of the ship's timbering in the
obliterating sands.</p>

<p>"I've been all over this ground before," he explained,
and for once in a way he seemed to have
thrown off the burden, whatever it was, that had
been weighing him down. "More than that, I've
waded around here when the tide was out and made
good on some of the guesses."</p>

<p>"Are you counting upon finding the lost treasure?"
I joked; and he took me up promptly.</p>

<p>"Why not? Stranger things than that have
happened, haven't they?"</p>

<p>"You don't really believe that part of the story,
do you, Bonteck?" said Madeleine, with an amused
smile.</p>

<p>"All or none," he answered cheerfully. "And,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
again, I say, why not? Don't you want to take a
few shares in the Great Galleon Treasure Company,
Unlimited?"</p>

<p>I thought it a happy circumstance that she could
meet him playfully in the open field of badinage.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," she returned. "If I had a
spade, I'd dig somewhere. Only I shouldn't know
where to dig."</p>

<p>"Suppose we figure out the probabilities," Bonteck
suggested, and if his enthusiasm wasn't real,
it was an exceedingly good imitation. "The first
requirement, of course, is to take the old story at
its face value. Just imagine Sir Francis Drake's
<i>Pasha</i>, or it might have been the <i>Swan</i>, out yonder
on the other side of the reef, pouring hot shot into
the poor, old, stranded <i>Santa Lucia</i> here on the
beach. The Spaniards would take the treasure out
over the bows, because that would be the only
sheltered place, don't you see? Does that suggest
anything?"</p>

<p>I think I have already said that Miss Barclay's
gift, or rather one of them, was an acutely responsive
mentality; or if I haven't, I meant to. She was
standing with Van Dyck upon the exact spot the
Spaniards&mdash;real or mythical&mdash;must have stood to
be out of cannon-shot reach in unloading the treasure.
Without a moment's hesitation she took up
the thread of Bonteck's imaginings.</p>

<p>"If they started from here they would run for
the nearest woods, wouldn't they?&mdash;keeping their
ship between them and the English cannons. That
is what I should have done." And then, purely in
a spirit of keeping up the fiction, I am sure: "Let
us follow them and see where they went."</p>

<p>Bonteck agreed at once. "Come on," he said;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and the three of us set out to cross the island in a
diagonal line, looking back from time to time to
keep the fancied direction of the Spaniards retreating
from their burning ship.</p>

<p>It was in a little open space in the midst of a
palm and palmetto thicket that we paused.</p>

<p>"This is the place," Madeleine announced calmly.
"Meaning to hide our treasure chest, we wouldn't
go all the way across to the other beach. We'd
hurry and scrape away the leaves and things here
in the thickest part of the woods, and dig a hole,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" said Bonteck, with what seemed a
certain breathless eagerness; "Go on and pick out
your place. We'll dig for you&mdash;Preble and I."</p>

<p>"You haven't anything to dig with," she laughed,
and then the laugh died, and I saw her eyes widen
and her lip begin to tremble. But in an instant
she was laughing again.</p>

<p>"I believe I had almost hypnotized myself," she
confessed, with a little grimace of self-consciousness.
"Do you see that white stone over there under the
vines? The thought came to me like a flash,
'<i>That stone was put there to mark the spot!</i>' You
have been making it all too uncannily real, Bonteck."</p>

<p>Van Dyck crossed the little open space and pulled
away a mass of trailing vines so that we could
examine the stone. It was a fragment of white
coral the size, and approximately the shape, of a
ship's capstan.</p>

<p>"It's a bit odd, anyway," Bonteck commented,
still apparently in the grip of the curious eagerness.
"There are no loose stones anywhere else on the
island, so far as I know, excepting the small pieces
we used in building our camp fireplace. You'd say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
this is a chunk of the outer reef, wouldn't you, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes, possibly," I answered. "But in
that case it must have been quarried and carried
ashore in some way, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bonteck straightened up and turned quickly to
Madeleine.</p>

<p>"Suppose we try to be serious for a minute or
so, if we can," he offered, with what appeared to
me to be forced soberness. "There is about one
chance in a hundred million that there really was a
buried treasure. That hundred millionth chance is
yours, Madeleine. Neither Dick nor I would have
noticed this piece of coral hidden under the vines
if you hadn't pointed it out. Shall we turn it
over for you?"</p>

<p>"I should never forgive you if you didn't," she
laughed back.</p>

<p>"All right. But it must be distinctly understood
that if there should happen to be a gold mine under
it, the treasure is all yours. Do you agree to that?"</p>

<p>"Of course it will be mine," she answered in
cheerful mockery. "I'll take Dick, here, for my
witness. He will testify that it was I who first saw
the stone&mdash;won't you, Dick? But we must make
haste. It is growing dark, and I must go back to
father."</p>

<p>We heaved at the coral boulder, Bonteck and I,
and rolled it aside out of its bed in the soft, sandy
soil. I was about to say that we couldn't dig very
far with only our bare hands for tools, when Bonteck
produced a huge clasp-knife of the kind that sailors
carry.</p>

<p>"Where shall we dig&mdash;right where the stone lay?"
he asked, with a queer grin.</p>

<p>"Right exactly where the stone lay," said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
young woman, charmingly precise and mandatory.</p>

<p>We went down on our knees and fell to work as
soberly as if the entire thing were not a poor flimsy
bit of comedy designed to push the growing anxieties
and fear tremblings a trifle farther into the background.
Bonteck loosened the friable soil with the
blade of his big knife, and I scooped it out, dog-fashion,
with my hands. In a few minutes we had
a hole knee-deep, and as we went on enlarging it,
I saw, or thought I saw, a strange transformation
taking place in Van Dyck. The playful manner
had fallen away from him like a cast-off garment.
His jaw was set and he was breathing hard. And
when he took his turns in the little pit he dug like
a madman.</p>

<p>It was not until after we had dug down to the
pure white sand of the subsoil that he gave over
and turned to Madeleine with a look in his eyes
that mirrored, or seemed to mirror, a shock of half-paralyzing
astoundment. I had never suspected
him of having any histrionic ability, but if he were
not really shocked, he was certainly giving a faultless
rendering of a man completely dazed.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's gone!" he exclaimed mechanically.
"You've been robbed, Madeleine; it was yours&mdash;all
yours, by the right of discovery&mdash;and&mdash;and it's
gone!"</p>

<p>"What sheer nonsense!" she retorted lightly.
"You are the one who is hypnotized now, Bonteck."
And then, carrying out the little comedy to its
proper curtain: "Of course, it is very singular that
we shouldn't find the hidden treasure; singular, and
dreadfully disappointing&mdash;after one has worked
one's imagination up to the point of believing anything
and everything. But we've had our laugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
out of it, and that is worth while, isn't it? Now
we must really be getting back to the others. It
will be dark before long, and we mustn't keep Mrs.
Van Tromp's dinner waiting."</p>

<p>Van Dyck was standing at the edge of the hole,
still figuring as one helplessly dumfounded&mdash;and
I wondered why he persisted in throwing himself
so extravagantly into the part-playing. While
Madeleine was speaking, I stooped to pass some of
the sand of the pit bottom through my fingers. It
was almost as fine as flour, and quite as white, but
upon closer inspection I saw that it was flecked in
spots with bits of black humus&mdash;humus like that
formed by well-rotted wood.</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute," I said, seized suddenly with
a notion that was to the full as absurd as that which
had led us to follow the imagined trail of the
Spaniards retreating from their burning ship; and
catching up Van Dyck's dropped clasp-knife I stepped
into the shallow hole we had dug.</p>

<p>There is no twilight to speak of in the tropics, and
the sunset glow was fading rapidly, but there was
still light enough to show the place in the pit
bottom where the bits of black humus were thickest.
At sight of them I became, in my turn, a foolish
madman, postulating a frantic gopher with a time
limit set in which he may hope to outdig the
scratching dogs in his burrow. But there was at
least a saving grain of method in my madness.
Every fresh stab of the knife brought up more of
the rotted wood, and presently the blade struck
something hard and unyielding.</p>

<p>"Hold your breath, you two," I gasped, and
groping hastily in the loosened sand with my hands
I found the hard thing that the knife blade had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
struck; found and unearthed it and straightened
up to lay it at Madeleine's feet.</p>

<p>It was a rudely cast ingot of dull-colored metal,
and its weight, in proportion to its size, was sufficient
proof of its quality. It was unmistakably
a billet of gold.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>




<h2>XI<br />
<br />
<small>FINDERS KEEPERS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the next few minutes after the discovery of
the bar of gold I think no one of the three of us
was wholly sane. Van Dyck and I fell over each
other in our eagerness to find out if there were more
of them, and as we dug deep in the treasure grave
Madeleine knelt at the edge of it and was to the
full as daft as either of us.</p>

<p>Digging and groping by turns, we flung out bar
after bar of the precious metal until there was a
heap of forty of them piled up in the little glade.
Forty was the exact number. When it was complete
we found that we had penetrated to the under-layer
of humus which told us that we had come to
the rotted bottom of the chest in which the treasure
had been buried.</p>

<p>I think Madeleine was the first to break the spell
of breathless silence that had fallen upon us while
we were digging and dog-scratching in the soft sand.</p>

<p>"It can't be true! I can't believe it!" she said,
over and over again. "We are dreaming; we <i>must</i>
be dreaming&mdash;all of us!"</p>

<p>Bonteck had hoisted himself out of the pit and
was poising one of the gold bars in his hands.</p>

<p>"It is a gloriously substantial dream, Madeleine,
dear," he said gravely, ignoring me as if I were deaf
and dumb and blind, or altogether of no account.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
"For a rough guess, I should say that these bars
will weigh thirty-five or forty pounds apiece, if not
more&mdash;say a quarter of a million, in round numbers,
for the lot. It isn't a fortune, dear, but it will
serve to&mdash;to buy you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke in with a frantic little cry of protest.</p>

<p>"But it isn't mine, Bonteck! It's&mdash;it's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was at this crisis that Van Dyck deigned to
take notice of me as being present and able to
answer to my name.</p>

<p>"She says it isn't hers, Preble. Tell her; make
her understand."</p>

<p>"It is most unquestionably yours, Madeleine,"
I assured her. "You will remember that Bonteck
told you there was one chance in a hundred million.
That chance has won out, and it has fallen to you,
incredible as it may seem. By all the laws of the
treasure seekers, the find is yours."</p>

<p>"But it must have belonged to some one, at
some time!" she objected, honest to the core.</p>

<p>I nodded. "It really belonged to the poor Peruvians
from whom the Spaniards looted it. We are
three or four centuries too late to restore it to the
unfortunate Incas. I'm afraid you'll have to take
it and keep it for your own."</p>

<p>"Of course she will keep it!" Bonteck thrust in.
"The only question is, what shall be done with it
now?"</p>

<p>At this we held a hurried consultation over the
disposition of the discovery, with Madeleine insisting
that we two ought at least to share the miraculous
treasure with her.</p>

<p>"Dick hates money, and I have too much of it,
as it is," was the manner in which Bonteck disposed
of the sharing suggestion; and then we decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
hastily upon two reasonable immediacies; we
would rebury the gold, replace the coral boulder,
and leave things as nearly as might be as we had
found them. And for the second reasonable conclusion
it was agreed that we should say nothing to
any of the other castaways at present. It could
do no good to tell them; and, as Bonteck sagely
argued, it might do a good bit of harm by stirring
up things at a time when we all needed to sit tight
in the boat.</p>

<p>We were working by starlight by the time we
got the hole filled up and the chunk of coral rolled
back into place, and we could hardly see well
enough to be certain that we had removed all
traces of our late activities. Hoping that we had,
and promising ourselves that we would return in
daylight to make sure, we set out upon the shortest
way back to the camp, which was along the north
beach.</p>

<p>Madeleine hadn't said anything more about the
ownership of the treasure while we were reinterring
it, but now she began again.</p>

<p>"I hope you're not sweeping me off my feet&mdash;you
two," she said. "I still can't make myself
believe that I have any better right to that gold
than you have&mdash;or as much."</p>

<p>"Of course you have," Bonteck insisted.
"Didn't you point out the stone to us, I'd like to
know?"</p>

<p>"But I should never have been there to point it
out if you hadn't shown the way," she asserted.</p>

<p>"We needn't split hairs over that part of it," I
put in. "And your argument doesn't hold, at that.
It was your suggestion that we follow the trail, or
the imaginary trail, from the old wreck to the&mdash;also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
imaginary&mdash;place where the Spaniards would
be likely to hide their gold. Don't you remember?"</p>

<p>"Oh," she laughed; "if I'm to be held accountable
for every silly thing I say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Once more Bonteck went over the equities patiently
and painstakingly. We, he and I, were
only bystanders. In no possible viewing of the
circumstances could either of us lay claim to any
essential part in the miraculous discovery. Waxing
eloquently argumentative, he made the establishment
of her right and title to the gold fill up
the entire time of our return, and if he didn't succeed
in fully convincing her, he was at least able
to talk her down and silence her.</p>

<p>At the camp under the palms at the western
extremity of our kingdom we found wild excitement
in the saddle, and our delayed return passed
unremarked. Just at sunset, Billy Grisdale and
Edith Van Tromp, who had been on watch at the
western signal fire, had seen the smoke of a steamer.
They had lost the hopeful sight in the gathering
dusk, and had raced in to spread the good news;
racing back again almost immediately, with a
snatched supper in their hands, to build the signal
fire higher.</p>

<p>With this announcement to upset monotonous
routine, the meal, which, for the sake of preserving
the most foolish of the civilized conventions, we
were still calling "dinner," was late, and it was
eaten by the more sanguine as the children of
Israel ate their first Passover, in haste and with
staff in hand. Both Billy and Edith had been
hopefully positive that the ship they had seen was
headed toward the island, and the bare prospect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of an early rescue was enough to key excitement
to the unnerving pitch.</p>

<p>But as time passed and nothing happened, the
inevitable reaction set in, and I think we all sank
deeper into the pit of depression for the sudden
awakening of hope. While Annette and Alicia and
Beatrice Van Tromp were clearing away the remains
of the belated meal, Grey drew me aside.</p>

<p>"You've kept your head better than any of us,
Preble," he began, "and there is a thing that ought
to be threshed out before it gets any older. They
are saying now that Bonteck is either crazy in his
head, or else he is the greatest villain unhung."</p>

<p>"Who is saying it?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"I don't know where it started, but with Ingerson
and the major and Barclay to reckon with, it
wouldn't be very hard to trace it back to its source.
The charge is that Van Dyck has been robbing the
commissary&mdash;spiriting the provisions away a little
at a time and hiding them out."</p>

<p>I knew that this was true, so far as the liquors
were concerned, but I kept my mouth shut about
that.</p>

<p>"What motive is assigned?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It is only hinted at, but the hint is gruesome
enough, the Lord knows. They say we are coming
to the end; to a time when there will be nothing
left but a survival of the strongest. And they say,
also, that if Bonteck isn't a bit off his head, he is
cold-bloodedly fixing things so that he will be able
to outlive the remainder of us."</p>

<p>I thrust an arm through Grey's and led him off
up the beach in the direction of the bay of the
Spaniards.</p>

<p>"You're not trying to tell me that you believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
any such hideous rot as that, are you?" I exploded,
after we had left the camp well to the rear.</p>

<p>"God knows, I don't want to believe it, Preble;
I pointedly don't believe the villainy charge. But
the other hint&mdash;that Bonteck may be losing his
grip on himself: we've all noticed it; you must have
noticed it. And it is scaring the women no end.
It is bad enough to have Ingerson around, licking
his lips and wolfing every drop of liquor he can get
his hands on; to have Barclay whining, and Miss
Gilmore showing her claws, and the major grabbing
for a little more than his share when he thinks
nobody is looking. I have been trying hard to
keep Annette from seeing and hearing. She has a
perfectly childish horror of crazy people, Preble,
and I&mdash;and we&mdash;&mdash;" he broke down and choked
over the thing that he was afraid to say, and I
tightened my grip on his arm.</p>

<p>"Brace up!" I broke out harshly. "We don't
have to say die until we're dead! You've got to
brace up for Annette's sake. If she sees you crumbling
it'll be all up with her&mdash;you know that much.
Past that, you kill off this idiotic blether about
Van Dyck every time you hear it. It's rot&mdash;the
wildest tommyrot! Bonteck has his load to carry,
and it's a good bit heavier than yours&mdash;or than
mine, for that matter. He isn't losing his mind,
and he hasn't been raiding the commissary. Say
those two things over to yourself and to Annette
until they sound real to you!"</p>

<p>Grey pulled his arm free, and I could fancy him
swallowing hard once or twice.</p>

<p>"I want to be a man, in&mdash;in your sense of the
word, Preble," he blurted out. "I used to be, I
think, before&mdash;before Annette came and snuggled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
down into the empty place in my heart and made
me see that it was up to me to carry the full cup
of her sweet life without spilling a drop of it. But
now&mdash;now when I look into her eyes and see the
awful thing lying at the back of them&mdash;the thing
that she's trying every minute of the day to keep
me from seeing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He got this far before he choked up again, and
now I couldn't be savage with him&mdash;which was
what he was most needing.</p>

<p>"I know," I said, with a far keener sympathy
than he suspected, for I, too, was seeing things in
a pair of slate-blue eyes&mdash;eyes that were braver
than Annette Grey's. "But we mustn't let down,
John; we can't let down, you and I. When the
pinches come, it's the man's privilege to buck up
and carry the double load. That is one of the
things we were made for." Then I tried to turn
him aside from the most intimate of the threatenings.
"About this smoke trail that the children
saw: could they really tell which way it was heading?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am afraid not. They didn't see the ship;
only the smoke. It was just at dusk, you know,
and they wouldn't have seen anything at all but
for the sunset glow in the west. It was quite dark
when they came running back to the camp, and
they were both so excited they couldn't talk
straight."</p>

<p>"But they did see a smoke?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. No doubt they thought they
did. But we've all been straining our eyes and
stirring up the little hope blazes until I think none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of us can be really certain of anything any more.
I guess there wasn't any ship."</p>

<p>"We needn't be too sure of that," I qualified.
"There was a ship of some sort on the southern
offing no longer ago than last Friday." And I
told him what Conetta and I had seen.</p>

<p>"And you never told us!" he said reproachfully.</p>

<p>"It was only a disappointment, as it turned out,
and sharing disappointments doesn't make them
any lighter. But you may tell Annette, if you
think it will help."</p>

<p>"It will help; I'll go back to camp and do it
now. Are you coming along?"</p>

<p>At first I thought I would. Then the remembrance
of what Grey had told me&mdash;about Van
Dyck's newest trouble&mdash;came to oppress me, asking
for solitude and some better chance of clarifying
itself.</p>

<p>"I think I'll stay here and smoke a pipe," I
said; and so we parted.</p>

<p>The pipe smoking had progressed no farther than
the lighting of the match when I saw some one
coming along the beach. I thought it was Grey
returning to say something that he had forgotten
to say, but when Billy Grisdale's dog came to sniff
in friendly fashion at me, I knew that the approaching
figure must be Billy.</p>

<p>"Jack Grey told me where I'd be likely to find
you," said the infant, coming up to cast himself
down upon the sand at my side. "Don't happen
to have another pinch of tobacco in your inside
pocket, do you?"</p>

<p>I had, and when his need was supplied he rolled
a cigarette in a bit of brown paper saved from some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of the provision wrappings and lighted it at the
glowing dottel of my pipe.</p>

<p>"Tough old world, isn't it?" he mourned,
stretching himself out luxuriously with his hands
locked under his head. "Edie and I thought we
were sittin' on top of it when we saw that smoke
trail just after sunset, but it was only a false alarm."</p>

<p>"You are sure you saw a smoke?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; there was no doubt about that. We
could see it as long as we could see anything. But
I guess we just joshed ourselves into thinking that
it was coming our way." He sat up to nurse his
knees and was silent for a little time. When he
began again it was to say: "You know these seas
better than any of us; is there any chance at all
that we'll ever be taken off?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lie down, Tige, old
boy, and take it easy. There's nothing to bite in
these diggings&mdash;more's the pity."</p>

<p>I answered Billy's question cheerfully as a duty
incumbent upon me, and I fancied he took the
forced optimism for exactly what it was worth.
While I was expatiating upon the law of lucky
chances, the bull pup was refusing to lie down and
take it easy; he was standing stiffly with his
crooked forelegs braced and his cropped ears cocked
as if at the approach of an enemy.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with the dog, Billy?" I
asked, and as I spoke, we both thought we saw the
answer in the lagoon at our feet. A triangular
black fin split the mirror-like surface for a brief
instant, and a twist of some huge under-sea body
turned the darkling water into lambent phosphorescent
flames. It was not the first shark we
had seen, but they seldom penetrated this far into
the lagoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" said Billy, stroking down the rising
hackles on the dog's back, "there's a quick way out
of it for you, little doggie, when the clock strikes
thirteen. One jump, and you'll never know what
hurt you. You won't jump, eh? You're foolish,
in your brain, old boy. It'll be much easier than
starving to death."</p>

<p>"Still in the doldrums, Billy?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Who wouldn't be? But I didn't chase out here
to swap glooms with you, Uncle Dick. I wanted
to ask you if you believe in this wild tale of the
Spaniards' buried treasure."</p>

<p>"I'll believe anything that will help to pass the
time," I replied evasively.</p>

<p>"Huh!" he said; "that is what you might call
the retort meaningless. Supposing there <i>was</i> a
treasure, and supposing you should stumble across
it: would it be yours?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know. I was just asking for information.
You wouldn't feel obliged to chop it up into
eighteen separate pieces and pass it around&mdash;like
a watermelon at a picnic?"</p>

<p>"Why should I?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just on general principles, I thought maybe;
all for one and one for all, and that sort."</p>

<p>With the miraculous discovery of the day&mdash;and
Madeleine's rights&mdash;fresh in mind, it seemed a
moment in which to tread carefully.</p>

<p>"Finders are keepers, the world over, Billy,"
I said. "I am a poor man, and I should probably
hog the treasure if I should find it."</p>

<p>"That's better," he returned. "We're all growing
so desperately inhuman that a fellow can't
tell where to draw the line any more. If I find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the Spaniards' gold, you needn't expect me to
whack up with you. I'm going to put my feet
in the trough and keep 'em there. Come on, old
doggie; let's go and hunt us a hole to burrow in.
There's another day coming, or if there isn't,
we shan't have anything more to worry about."</p>

<p>He got up to go back to the camp, whistling to
the dog as he moved off. For the second time the
bull pup braced himself, showing his teeth and
growling a bit, and this time there was no disturbance
in the lagoon to account for it. But
Billy whistled again and the dog started to follow
his master, looking back from time to time, as if
he went reluctantly; and once more I wondered
what he saw or heard or smelled.</p>

<p>As it fell out, the answer to this wondering query
did not keep me waiting. Billy Grisdale's shadowy
figure had barely disappeared in the down-shore
distance when another and much more substantial
one broke out of the jungle just behind me, and I
got upon my feet to find Ingerson confronting me.</p>

<p>"What's all this talk about things being buried?"
he demanded morosely.</p>

<p>"Listening, were you?" said I, taking small
pains to keep the contempt out of my voice.</p>

<p>He threw himself down on the sand and sat with
his arms resting on his knees and his hands locked
together.</p>

<p>"I'm in hell, Preble," he muttered. Then he
unclasped his hands and held one of them up.
"Look at that."</p>

<p>Dark as it was I could see the upheld hand
shaking like a leaf in the wind.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You know well enough; I'm over the edge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Van Dyck's killing me by inches. He wants to
kill me."</p>

<p>"Liquor, you mean?"</p>

<p>His answer was a groan. "I haven't had one
good drink in three days&mdash;not enough to make one
good drink. It's got me, Preble. I didn't know.
I've always had it when I wanted it. If you've
got a heart in you, you'll show me where he's
hiding the stuff. I'll go mad if you don't."</p>

<p>I wanted to tell him that it would be small loss
to the rest of us if he should, but I didn't. As a
person who is strictly the architect of his own
misery, a drink maniac may command little commiseration,
but his sufferings are none the less
real, for all that. Sitting there on the sands, with
the fires of the drunkard's Gehenna burning inside
of him, Ingerson was a pitiable object. Still, remembering
some of the brutal things that had been
charged up to his account, and not less the cold-blooded
bargain he was seeking to drive with Holly
Barclay, I didn't waste much sympathy upon him.</p>

<p>"It is a good time in which to show that you are
a human being, and not a beast, Ingerson," I
said. "Thus far, you've been merely a clog on
the wheels, and the day is coming, if, indeed, it
isn't already here, when those of us who are men
will have to remember that there are nine helpless
women on this island whose wants must be supplied
before ours are."</p>

<p>He looked up at me. "You mean that the food's
going&mdash;or gone?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, and then he laughed.
It was the cracked laugh of a man on the brink.</p>

<p>"Eighteen mouths to fill, and nothing to fill 'em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
with. You've said it, Preble; I'm nothing but a
dead weight in the boat&mdash;a bump on a log. I'll
remove one of the hungry mouths," and before I
had the slightest idea of what he meant, he sprang
up and hurled himself into the lagoon.</p>

<p>Thinking that the plunge was only the mad
impulse of a half-crazed drunkard denied, and
hoping that a salt-water soaking would bring him
to his senses, I made no move at first. But when
I saw him deliberately wade out over his depth
and strike out with strong swimming strokes for
the reef over which the ground swell was breaking,
I remembered the black fin Grisdale and I had seen
and shouted a warning.</p>

<p>"Come back here, you fool!" I called. "There's
a man-eater in there! Come back, I say!"</p>

<p>I don't suppose he heard me; if he did, he paid
no attention. I confess, with decent shame, that
I hesitated when it became evident that he meant
to carry out his threat of effacing himself. His
life was of little benefit, to himself or to others, and
if he lived, it would only be to add the care of a
madman to our other calamities. I have been glad
a thousand times since that this was merely a
passing thought. The real motivating impulse came
from the sight of a V-shaped ripple racing diagonally
across the lagoon to intercept the swimmer; a
ripple plainly discernible on the starlit surface of
the reef-bound inlet. It was the shark again.</p>

<p>What happened after that will remain a nightmare
to me as long as memory serves. I was stripping
my coat and kicking off my shoes when Van
Dyck came bursting out of the wood behind me.</p>

<p>"Who is that out there?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Ingerson&mdash;he's gone off his head!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Without another word Van Dyck ran down to
the shore and took the water in a clean dive. When
he came up he was within arm's reach of the dipsomaniac.
There was a fierce grapple and both
men went under. My heart was in my mouth. I
made sure the shark had taken one or the other of
them. But the end was not yet. As I waded out
armpit deep, splashing and making all the noise
I could in the hope of scaring the great fish, two
heads bobbed up a few yards away, and I saw that
Bonteck had either choked or drowned the would-be
suicide into submission and was swimming in with
him.</p>

<p>A few quick strokes gave me my chance to help,
and together we dragged Ingerson ashore. He
was half-drowned and was otherwise little more
than a bedraggled wreck of a man. While we were
working over him, Van Dyck explained&mdash;briefly.
Edith Van Tromp had told him that she had seen
Ingerson creeping into the wood on all fours, with
a knife in his hand, and he&mdash;Bonteck&mdash;had followed.
All day he had been suspecting that Ingerson
was on the edge of delirium.</p>

<p>"You'll have to give him some of the hair of the
dog that bit him, or we'll have a frantic maniac
in our midst," I said. "Is there any liquor left?"</p>

<p>"A little. Stay with him and I'll go and get it."</p>

<p>He was gone only a few minutes, and by the time
he came back, Ingerson was able to sit up. We
fed him brandy in small doses, and as the fiery
stuff got in its work some degree of sanity returned.
Apparently he knew quite well what he had tried
to do, and was surlily regretful that the attempt had
failed.</p>

<p>"You made a bonehead play, Van Dyck," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
shivered. "I was trying to do a decent thing to
wind up with, and you blocked it. You'd better
have let me alone."</p>

<p>Van Dyck did not reply, and the drink maniac
went on monotonously:</p>

<p>"I wanted to wind it up. Old John B.'s got me.
I didn't believe it, but the last three days have
shown me where I was heading in. As long as you
can keep me half lit up .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but you can't do
that forever."</p>

<p>"No," said Bonteck gravely; "this is the last
bottle."</p>

<p>Ingerson's head had fallen forward upon his breast.</p>

<p>"One more&mdash;little nip, and then&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I&mdash;can&mdash;go&mdash;to&mdash;sleep,"
he mumbled; and at this
we gave him the sleeping potion and in another
half-minute he was dead to the world.</p>

<p>Hard-hearted as it may seem, we made short
work of disposing of him. We were a long quarter
of a mile from the camp, and, short of carrying him,
there was no way to get him there. So we merely
dragged his limp and sodden bulk up to a little
open space under the trees and left it.</p>

<p>"I'm beginning to think he was more than half
right about the bonehead play," said Van Dyck
sourly as he carefully hid the last of the brandy
bottles. "It is only a question of a little time&mdash;and
his swigging of the last thimbleful of the stuff&mdash;when
we'll have to hog-tie him in self-defense.
Let's do a sentry-go around to the far end of
things. We may as well dry out tramping as any
other way."</p>

<p>And it was not until he said this that I realized
that we, too, were as sodden as the limp figure we
had hauled up under the palms.</p>

<h2>XII<br />
<br />
<small>BONTECK UNLOADS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Walking</span> briskly to give our soaked clothes a
chance to drip and dry out a bit, Van Dyck and
I passed around the bay of the ancient wreck and
in due course of time came to the heel of the
sandspit in which the island terminated eastward.
Here we found our signal rag hanging motionless
on its tree mast, but the fire at the foot of the
tree had gone out, and as our matches were wet we
could not rekindle it.</p>

<p>I proposed going back to camp for more matches,
but Bonteck said no, that it was hardly worth
while and, pointing to a hazy gray mist bank in
the east which was slowly rising to blot out the
stars in that quarter of the heavens, he added:
"That cloud means weather; most likely the kind
that would put the fire out if we should make one.
If you're not too chilly, sit down and put your back
to a tree. There's a thing that needs to be hammered
out between us, Dick, before we get any
farther along."</p>

<p>I found a place where the sand was dry and
warm, and sat down, and he squatted beside me.
I wanted to smoke, and was absent-minded enough
to fill my pipe with damp tobacco before I remembered
that there were no matches. As to the
chilliness, even the wet clothes merely gave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
effect of a steam bath. Within the half-hour the
night had grown oppressively hot and the dead
air was like that of an oven.</p>

<p>"Go ahead with your hammering," I said, adding:
"There are several little matters that need
explaining&mdash;from my point of view."</p>

<p>"It's coming to you&mdash;and to the others," he returned
promptly. "I've been standing it off from
day to day, hoping that the explanations might be
made after the fact, instead of in the thick of it.
But I've about reached the end of my rope. Mrs.
Van Tromp told me after dinner this evening that
she could serve possibly half a dozen more meals
for the eighteen of us."</p>

<p>"Six meals; two days. We should have gone on
reduced rations long ago. We've been wasting like
drunken sailors."</p>

<p>"I know it. But I kept putting that off, too.
Hoping against hope, I guess you'd call it. You
know what a scare it would have thrown into everybody
if the food scarcity had been made public."</p>

<p>"Quite so. But the scare will have to come now,
and the suddenness of it won't make it any lighter."</p>

<p>"That is one of the things that is grinding me,
but only one. I've been carrying a pretty heavy
back-load, Dick, and the time has come when I've
got to shift some of it&mdash;if I'm to keep from going
the way Ingerson did a little while ago. But first,
a word about that treasure find we made a few
hours back; you'll stand by me in that, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"In the matter of convincing Madeleine of the
justice of taking the treasure for her own? Certainly."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I thought I could count upon your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
help there. It is a godsend to her, Dick. Don't
you see that it is?"</p>

<p>"I see that it will enable her to pay her father
out of his theft debt, and by that means to purchase
her own freedom," I rejoined. Then I
added: "But I can't surround the miraculous part
of it, Bonteck. In fact, I'm afraid I shall have to
see and handle the gold again before I can be sure
I'm not dreaming&mdash;as Madeleine said we all three
were. There are too many impossibilities."</p>

<p>He was silent for a full minute before he said:
"Yes, there are impossibilities&mdash;a good few of
them. And yet there are not so many as there
appeared to be." Another pause, and then:
"Dick, I've had the shock of my life."</p>

<p>"I can believe it," I said; "so had I. But just
what do you mean?"</p>

<p>Once more he seemed to be trying to shape things
in his mind so that they should issue in some sort
of orderly array.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you presently: that is why I wanted to
get you by yourself. But there is something else
that has to be told first. As I say, I've put it off
as long as I can. You will want to tie a stone around
my neck and heave me into the sea when you've
heard what I have to say, and I shan't blame you.
As the thing has turned out, I'm a cold-blooded
assassin&mdash;no less."</p>

<p>"Open confession is good for the soul," I commented,
but even as I spoke, all the surmises and
half-suspicions that had been troubling me for days
and weeks came tumbling in to make a mental
chaos where there should have been calm judgment
and a fair weighing of motives.</p>

<p>"To begin at the beginning, then," he went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
doggedly. "So far as I knew at the time, there was
no mutiny on board the <i>Andromeda</i>. It was a
plant from start to finish. I had two objects in
view. The first and craziest was the notion that
I handed you that night at dinner in New Orleans&mdash;the
notion of cutting out a little bunch of people
from the world&mdash;my world&mdash;and making them pull
off their masks. It was a barbarous idea; a crudely
savage one, if you like; only I couldn't see that side
of it. I meant to make it a sort of unexpected
picnic, providing carefully against all of the real
hardships, but at the same time letting the shock
do what it might towards the unmasking."</p>

<p>"I am trying to give you what credit I can for
the carefully planned ameliorations," I said. "But
that doesn't excuse your appallingly selfish motive.
Go on. It was all prearranged with Goff, I take
it?"</p>

<p>"Thoughtfully prearranged. And the motive
wasn't wholly selfish, as you will find out a little
farther along. Goff was to steer for this island,
the longitude and latitude of which, as I told you,
I had obtained from the captain of the tramp
steamer that rescued you and the other survivors
of the <i>Mary Jane</i>, and at the critical moment there
was to be a fake mutiny and a real marooning. It
was by my instructions that Goff didn't appear in
the marooning mix-up. I wanted him to be able
to show a clean bill of health when the play was
over. He was to pick his men for the mutiny
demonstration and the marooning job, leaving the
marooned ones to infer that he, and the handful
of Americans in the engine-room and fire-hold, had
been overpowered."</p>

<p>Again I said, "Go on," and tried to hold judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in suspense until after the evidence should
all be in.</p>

<p>"We were to be left here for three weeks, and
at the end of that period the yacht was to come
back and take us off; Goff with a sailor's yarn of
how he had finally got the better of the rebellion
and resumed his command."</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;excellent good!" I applauded cynically.
"And the three weeks were up just an even fortnight
ago yesterday."</p>

<p>"That is why I had to tell you!" he burst out.
"It is killing me by inches, Dick! Something has
gone wrong; something must have gone frightfully
wrong. I was only stalling when I led you to
believe that I didn't know Goff, personally; I do
know him; I have known him for years, and I'd
wager my life that he is as true as steel. I began
to be scared when I found that the little black-eyed
devil of an under-steward, Lequat, had been
picked to play the part of the heavy villain. I
couldn't imagine&mdash;I can't yet imagine&mdash;why Goff
should have chosen him."</p>

<p>Again a silence came and sat between us. While
Bonteck had been talking, the night had grown
still hotter and more stifling. As yet, the stars
were burning in a clear sky overhead, but there
was a gray, shadowy blur in the east behind which
a late moon was struggling to rise. The blur,
cloud-bank or a gathering fog, had been growing
and extending by almost imperceptible degrees as
we sat staring afar at it. In any latitude it would
have presaged a change of weather; in that of our
island it might well be the forerunner of a tropical
storm. Still, there was no breath of air stirring,
and the surface of the inclosed lagoon was like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
that of burnished metal. And the heat, as I have
said, was terrific.</p>

<p>"You once told me a tale about a certain fabulous
sum of money that had been shipped in the
<i>Andromeda</i>," I said at length. "Was that another
of your romantic little inventions?"</p>

<p>"No; I suppose I shall have to confess that part
of it, as well," he returned, more than half shamefacedly,
I thought. "You know the criminal trap
Holly Barclay has set for himself by squandering
young Vancourt's fortune, and how he was purposing
to get out of the trap. It is precisely as I
told you when we spoke of it before; he is ready to
sell Madeleine to the highest bidder. That is a
pretty brutal way to put it, but stripped of all the
civilized masqueradings that is exactly what it
amounts to. And he had already given the option
to Hobart Ingerson; I know it&mdash;knew it before I
left New York. Do you get that?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I nearly went wild trying to think up some
scheme that would break the Ingerson combination
and at the same time pass muster with Madeleine.
She loves me, Dick; she has admitted it; and if
this miserable money tangle were out of the way,
she'd marry me. But she wouldn't let me buy her
freedom; she said if she had to be sold like a slave
on the auction block, it certainly wouldn't be to
the man she loved. God bless her sweet soul! I
don't blame her for that. Do you?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least. But you found a way to
whip the devil round the stump?"</p>

<p>"The maddest way you ever heard of&mdash;a perfectly
idiotic way, you will say; and this winter
cruise in the yacht was the chief move in it. I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
to have Madeleine in the party, and, of course, I
couldn't have her without her father. Including
him meant including Ingerson. It says itself that
Barclay, with the threat of a prison sentence hanging
over him, wouldn't be willing to lose sight of
his one best bet."</p>

<p>"I know," I nodded; "know more than you think
I do, perhaps. Get on with your story."</p>

<p>"Reading a story is what put the notion into
my head, in the beginning. In an old book of the
Elizabethan voyages and discoveries I came across
this tale of a burned galleon and a treasure that
was never found. What I wanted to do was to
put enough money into Madeleine's hands&mdash;money
that she would believe was unquestionably her
own&mdash;to square up her father's crooked accounts.
This 'Treasure Island' business seemed to offer the
means. About that time I ran across Captain
Svenson, the commander of your rescue ship, and
besides giving me the latitude and longitude of
this island, he told me that he believed it to be the
'Lost Island' of the old English privateers, and
the same which was known later, in the buccaneers'
time, as 'Pirates' Hope.' Also, he told me that
you had told him of the existence of the old wreck.
Don't let me bore you with too much detail."</p>

<p>"I am too greatly infuriated to be bored. What
is the rest of it?"</p>

<p>"Mere romantic flubdub, you'll say. I bought
from the subtreasury a quarter of a million dollars
in gold bars&mdash;and had a devil of a time cooking up
a reasonable excuse for the purchase, as you would
imagine. These bars I had remelted and cast into
rough ingots of about forty pounds each. As a
matter of secrecy, and to make them easily portable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
each of the ingots was packed in a box by
itself, the boxes were marked 'Ammunition,' and
it was as ammunition that the stuff was secretly
put aboard the <i>Andromeda</i> at her North River
anchorage."</p>

<p>"Sure!" I derided. "When ostriches do a much
less naïve thing we call them silly birds. I'd be
willing to bet largely that any number of New
York crooks knew what was in your cartridge boxes
long before you ever got them overside in the
<i>Andromeda</i>. What next?"</p>

<p>"Next, I cleared the yacht for Havana, having
first made arrangements to have the winter-cruise
party meet me in New Orleans some three weeks
later. I'll admit now that I was a bit shaky about
some part of my crew. I had told Goff that I
didn't want too much intelligence aboard, and after
we put to sea it struck me that he had rather
overdone the thing. We had a few Provincetown
Portuguese who were all right, but the lot Goff
picked up in New York&mdash;foreigners to a man&mdash;didn't
look very good to me; nothing especially
desperate, you know, but with the gold on board
it seemed up to me to keep a weather eye open."</p>

<p>"Some glimmerings of common sense now and
then: you're to be congratulated," I said.</p>

<p>"Rub it in; I've got it coming to me. Holding
that cautious notion in mind, I made the southward
voyage look as much like a pleasure jaunt as possible,
touching at Havana, again at Port au Prince,
and a little later at Kingston. From Jamaica we
shot across to South American waters, and at
Curaçao I gave the bulk of the crew shore leave for
two days. Then, with the bunch stripped down
to Goff, the engine- and fire-room squads, and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
or three of the Portuguese, we made a fly-by-night
run to this island. You've got my notion by this
time, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Partly; but go on."</p>

<p>"We made land about two o'clock in the morning,
rounded this point of the island, and dropped
anchor just off the inlet opening to Spaniards' Bay.
With all hands off duty for the night, Goff and I
got the electric launch overside and landed the
gold&mdash;which was some job for just the two of us;
something over fifteen hundred pounds in the lot.
But, as I say, we got it ashore, lugged it piecemeal
to the little inland glade, and there, by the light
of a ship's lantern, we buried it, taking the precaution
to mark the place with that chunk of
coral."</p>

<p>"Um," said I. "So the chunk of coral was there,
waiting for you, was it? Didn't it occur to you
then to wonder how it got there?"</p>

<p>"It didn't. I'll confess I was pretty well wrought
up. A dark, deep-laid plot&mdash;even one that you
have framed up yourself&mdash;gets hold of you at the
climax, and all I thought of at the time was the
need for getting the job finished without letting
anybody but Goff into the secret of it."</p>

<p>"You had taken Goff into your confidence?"</p>

<p>"To some extent, of course; I had to. He knew
we were burying a small fortune, but he didn't
know, and doesn't yet know, what my object was.
After we had buried the gold, we filled the boxes
with sand so they wouldn't advertise too plainly the
fact that they'd been tampered with, nailed them up,
ferried them aboard, and stowed them in the forehold
in the place from which we had taken them."</p>

<p>I chuckled. The whole thing was so childishly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
romantic that it sounded like a tale lifted bodily
from the pages of a dime thriller. Moreover, it
was so absurdly out of character with the Van
Dyck I knew, or thought I had been knowing. Yet
I fancy the wildly romantic vein lies but shallowly
buried even in the soberest of us; and in Bonteck's
case the incredulities were put out of court by the
fact itself: he had actually done the incredible
thing.</p>

<p>"It is all plain enough now," I said; "all but
the silly childishness of the entire transaction.
You were meaning to sow the seed by telling the
old Spanish galleon fairy tale to the assembled
company, taking a chance of inducing Madeleine
to join in the treasure hunt&mdash;as you did this
afternoon, most successfully, as I must admit."</p>

<p>"Yes; but hold on. We buried the gold and
marked the place with the chunk of coral, as I
have said; and that was the end of it until this
afternoon. For the past fortnight I've been manoeuvering
to get you and Madeleine together and
away from the others, so that I could work the
rabbit's foot of the old galleon story upon her,
with you for a witness. When the chance came, it
worked out just as I'd planned to have it&mdash;up
to a certain point. Madeleine saw the stone, and
she is persuaded she saw it first. We rolled it aside
and dug the hole. It was after we had got down
about two feet that my shock came along and hit
me. I don't mind admitting that I nearly had a
full-blown case of heart failure. Dick, <i>my</i> gold
was gone!"</p>

<p>"Ha!" I exclaimed; "so that was what was the
matter with you, was it? What is the answer?
Did Goff come back after you'd gone to bed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the night of the funeral and disinter the corpse?"</p>

<p>Van Dyck shook his head. "He is one of the
few men in this world whom I would trust to the
limit, Richard. I can't believe it of him."</p>

<p>"Yet the deductions point plainly in his direction,"
I ventured. "Your gold is gone, you say,
and he was the only person besides yourself who
knew where to look for it. Past that, the yacht is
gone, and it doesn't come back to take us off. How
do you explain these two small inconsequences?"</p>

<p>"I can't explain them. There is only one explanation
that I can think of&mdash;and that is merely
a raw guess. There is a bare possibility that the
mutiny was real instead of a fake. Lequat's part
in it makes it look a bit that way. If you've got
his identity right, I'm certain he didn't ship with
us at New York, and equally certain that I saw
him on shore in Havana. As you'd imagine, I've
been trying mighty hard not to accept that solution
of the thing. If a bunch of real pirates have captured
the yacht, we stand a pretty poor chance
of ever seeing it again."</p>

<p>While he was speaking, the first few precursor
whiffs of wind came out of the rising cloud bank in
the east. With the moon and a full half of the
stars blotted out, the darkness had increased until
the only thing visible to seaward was the white
line of surf curling over the outer reef. I wasn't
accepting Bonteck's belief in Goff's impeccability
entirely at its face value. A quarter of a million
dollars, in a form that couldn't possibly be traced&mdash;namely,
in unmarked gold bars&mdash;was a pretty
big temptation to any man.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure that the gold we dug up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
wasn't your own hoard, merely buried a bit deeper
than you thought it was?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Altogether sure," was the prompt reply. "The
bars are not quite the same shape, and they are
rougher and look immeasurably older. No; unbelievable
as it may seem, the hundred-millionth
chance shook itself out of the box at the first
throw. It was the galleon's gold that we found."</p>

<p>"But wait a minute," I said. "Were the two
lots buried under the same stone?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" he queried. "Why shouldn't
they be? Goff and I found the stone there and
rolled it aside and dug a shallow hole under it.
When we were through, we rolled it back. If we
had gone a little deeper we would have found
what we three found this afternoon. The one
unaccountable thing is the disappearance of my
plant. It's gone; there is no question about that."</p>

<p>"What do you care for a quarter of a million
dollars, so long as Madeleine has been put in the
way of purchasing her freedom?" I mocked. "I
don't imagine you are going to quarrel with the
sheerly miraculous part of it. The thing that is
worrying me most, just now, is the fear that the
miracle won't go on miracling. Madeleine's gold
bars won't do her much good if we've all got to
stay on this cursed island and starve to death.
And that brings us down to the threadbare old
seam again. You say we have only six full meals
left; if we all go on short commons at once we may
live a week longer before we have to fall back upon
the shell-fish and cocoanuts."</p>

<p>"Yes," he returned gloomily, "that is what it
is coming to." Then: "What ought I to do, Dick?&mdash;go
and tell the others what I have told you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
let them burn me at the stake? It's about what
I deserve."</p>

<p>His manner of saying this carried me swiftly
back to an older time, reincarnating for me the
Bonteck Van Dyck who had been my college chum;
generous, large-hearted, always quick to admit
himself in the wrong when he was in the wrong.
Even with the knowledge that Conetta must suffer
with the rest of us, I could not flay him as he
deserved.</p>

<p>"You are not all bad, Bonteck," I remarked.
"Billy Grisdale and Edie owe you something, and
I'm beginning to wonder if I'm not in your debt,
too. You had a purpose in including Conetta and
her aunt, and Jerry Dupuyster, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I had. It seemed a thousand pities
that you and Conetta couldn't get together on some
sort of a living basis."</p>

<p>"It happens to be too late to do me any good;
Dupuyster has already asked her," I said. "Just
the same, I'm grateful for the intention; so grateful
that I'm not going to be the one to tie you to the
stake when the others pass sentence upon you. But
all this is dodging the main question. What are we
going to do? We men, or at least the six of us who
call ourselves men, can't stand by and let the other
twelve simply curl up and die when the food is
gone."</p>

<p>"I haven't any plan," he replied. "As I said a
while back, I've just been hanging on and hoping
against hope. There is still a chance, you know.
The yacht's engines may have broken down. Goff
may have had to put in somewhere&mdash;at some one of
the European-owned islands&mdash;and is having difficulty
in getting permission to sail. That might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
easily happen, since he is only a sailing-master
and has no written authority to show. Taking
that view of it, any one of a dozen things might
have got in the way to keep him from reaching us
at the appointed time."</p>

<p>"True enough. But that hope is based upon the
supposition that your original plan is still in the
saddle. It ignores the other alternative&mdash;that the
mutiny may have been a real one. Also, it ignores
the disappearance of the quarter million&mdash;your
quarter million&mdash;which, taken by itself, has a
pretty dubious look. I know you don't care anything
about the money part of it, now that Madeleine
has been provided for by a miracle; but the
evanishment of your gold bars would seem to have
a very pointed bearing upon our present situation.
I can't take your trust in Goff at par. If he didn't
come back here and get that gold an hour or so
after it was buried, he did the next best thing&mdash;which
was to come ashore and move the landmark."</p>

<p>"Yes; but, man alive! don't you see what that
presupposes? You are assuming that in moving
the chunk of coral he placed it exactly over the
other mess of gold bars. I grant you that such a
thing might happen, but you know well enough
that it wouldn't happen&mdash;that there are a thousand
chances to one against its happening."</p>

<p>I had to admit that my second hypothesis was
too lame to have a leg to stand on, though it was
the more hopeful one of the two. If Goff hadn't
resurrected the lately buried quarter million&mdash;if
he had only moved the marking stone&mdash;with due
and careful measurements so that he could find the
place again&mdash;there was some chance of his coming
back to the island&mdash;after we were all safely starved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to death. But these speculations weren't getting
us anywhere, and I said so.</p>

<p>"We're talking in circles," I complained. "All
the gold there is lying under that nubbin of coral,
added to the truck-load you've lost and can't
find, wouldn't buy a single meal for this crowd of
ours after the provisions are gone. Let's get to
work and do something. There is enough timber
left in the wreck of the <i>Mary Jane</i> to build a raft,
and we have an axe&mdash;if Jerry hasn't lost it while
he was chopping firewood. You have the latitude
and longitude of this prison of ours. How far is
it to somewhere&mdash;anywhere?"</p>

<p>Van Dyck did not reply at once. The wind was
coming in little catspaws now, and the curious
haze, which was by this time obscuring the entire
heavens, was shot through with a sort of ghostly
half light that was neither lightning nor a reflection
from the darkling sea. When Van Dyck spoke,
it was not in answer to my question about the
latitude and longitude.</p>

<p>"Hurricane conditions, I should say; wouldn't
you?" he said, getting upon his feet. "If they are,
we'd better be hiking back to the other end of the
island. Our camp is too near the beach to be
safe, even if the wind should come straight out of
the east. What do you think about it? You know
more about tropical storms than I do."</p>

<p>I was about to reply that a man might live half
a life-time in the tropics and still have much to
learn about weather conditions, when he suddenly
reached down and gripped my arm.</p>

<p>"Look!" he jerked out. "No, not there&mdash;right
here&mdash;close in&mdash;just outside of the reef!"</p>

<p>I looked and saw what he saw. A short quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of a mile to the southeastward, with no lights showing
and with her slowly turning engines making no
sound that we could hear, a ship, ghostly white and
shadowy in the curious light, was creeping, phantom-like,
toward the south shore of the island. It
was the <i>Andromeda</i>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>




<h2>XIII<br />
<br />
<small>THE WIND AND THE WAVES ROARING</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Most</span> naturally, the reappearance of the yacht,
at a moment when we had practically worked our
way around to the conclusion that it was extremely
doubtful if we should ever see her again, quickly
put the reasoned deductions to flight. But a second
glance threw all the hopeful machinery violently
into the reverse. The <i>Andromeda's</i> stealthy
approach with all lights hidden, and the evident
intention on the part of whoever was in command
to make land on the side of the island farthest
removed from the place of our debarkation, gave
no promise of rescue.</p>

<p>"The gold!" I exclaimed; and the two words
collided with Van Dyck's: "They are coming back
after it!"</p>

<p>"But hold on," I interjected. "<i>Your</i> gold is
gone, and they don't know&mdash;can't know&mdash;anything
about the Spanish treasure. If it's buried treasure
they're coming after, somebody on board the yacht
has the wrong tip, to a dead moral certainty."</p>

<p>Van Dyck made a gesture like a man groping in
the dark.</p>

<p>"There were the sand-filled boxes," he offered.
"They've opened them. They know that the gold
has been unshipped somewhere, and I suppose it
wasn't impossible for them to find out that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
yacht made a flying trip to this island after the
greater part of the crew had been given shore leave
at Willemstadt."</p>

<p>"You needn't go so far afield for an explanation,"
I countered. "Goff knew where the gold was unshipped;
and, by the same token, he is probably
the only man aboard of the yacht who knows the
latitude and longitude of Pirates' Hope. None of
the others could have found the way back here."</p>

<p>"But a few minutes ago you were accusing Goff
of making away with the gold on the night of its
burial," was the quick retort.</p>

<p>"Wait," I interposed. "I said he did one of
two things: dug your gold up and took it aboard
after you were asleep, or else he came ashore and
moved that block of coral. Evidently the latter
half of the guess was the correct one."</p>

<p>At this, he began to give ground a little.</p>

<p>"You may be right. Still, I can't believe it of
Goff. There is a chance that, notwithstanding my
thinning out of the crew at Willemstadt, we still
had a traitor aboard. In that case we may have
been spied upon when we landed the gold&mdash;Goff
and I. I'm still hanging to the belief that there
was a real mutiny, and in that case Goff may have
been given a choice between steering them back
here or walking the plank."</p>

<p>This purely academic discussion of the whys and
wherefores went on while the <i>Andromeda</i> was edging
nearer and nearer to the outer reef barrier,
still as silently as a ghost ship, and still without
showing a sign of life on deck or bridge, so far as
we could make out. Within a stone's throw of the
reef she slowed to a stand, and not until then did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
we hear the low rumbling of her engines as they
were reversed to check her headway.</p>

<p>Since the yacht's approach had been from the
eastward, she lay broadside on to the island. We
could see the electric motor launch hanging in its
davit tackle on the starboard side, but there was
no move made to lower it.</p>

<p>"They are not using any steam winches to-night,"
was Van Dyck's muttered comment upon
this. "Too much noise. Listen!"</p>

<p>There was a splash, apparently on the port side
of the vessel, faint sounds as of oars feathering in
muffled rowlocks, and a little later the yacht's yawl
crept out around the sharp stem of the <i>Andromeda</i>
and headed for a narrow inlet through the reef.
There were seven or eight men in the small boat;
four at the oars, one in the bow and either two or
three aft.</p>

<p>At sight of this landing party Bonteck came alive
with gratifying promptness.</p>

<p>"Whether your guess is the right one or not,
Dick, there is one thing certain: If we let those
fellows go to digging around in our bullion patch,
they will find what we found, and Madeleine will
lose out, after all. We can't let it stand that way.
What do you say?"</p>

<p>I had whipped out my pocket-knife and was cutting
a club, or trying to, though the sapling mahogany,
or whatever it was I was hacking at, was
tougher than a leather whipstock.</p>

<p>"I'm not thinking so much about the gold," I
said. "It's up to us to capture this yawl crew
first, and the <i>Andromeda</i> afterward. Get yourself
a weapon of some sort&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>"Of course," he agreed at once, feeling in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
pocket for the big clasp-knife which he had used
for a digging tool a few hours earlier. "Something
of that kind is what I meant. Shall we rush 'em
when they beach the yawl? Or had we better
wait a bit and see what they mean to do?"</p>

<p>In our excitement I think neither of us saw the
absurdity of two men armed only with clubs proposing
to attack seven or eight who were probably
provided with firearms.</p>

<p>"We'd better wait," I said; but we made good in
the matter of time saving by hurrying through the
wood to post ourselves handily in a palmetto
thicket on the southward-fronting beach edge near
the place toward which the yawl, now entering the
lagoon, was headed.</p>

<p>The dash through the wood from our observation
point at the heel of the eastern sandspit seemed to
me the hottest sprint I had ever made. Once
more the breeze had died out, and with little or no
air stirring in the open, in the forest the atmosphere
was absolutely lifeless. I don't know how near
the running dash came to winding Van Dyck, but
when we reached the palmetto thicket the perspiration
was pouring out of me in trickling streams,
and I was fairly gasping for breath. There was a
half-paralyzing portent in the stillness and the terrible
heat. It was as if subterranean fires had been
kindled under the island, and that curious back-lighting
of the haze by the rising moon seemed now
to have a faintly lurid glow as if it were catching
the reflection of the unseen fires.</p>

<p>"Heavens&mdash;but this is awful!" Van Dyck muttered
under his breath&mdash;from which I argued that
he was suffering no whit less from the heat than I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
was. "If we get the weather that this is promising
to give us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" I whispered.</p>

<p>The yawl, pulled strongly by its four oarsmen,
was sweeping up to the beach, skimming the surface
of the lagoon like some gigantic water bug.
But a moment later we found that we had miscalculated
the landing place. After coming within a
pebble's toss of the shore&mdash;to be the better hidden
by the palm shadows, as we supposed&mdash;the helmsman
swung the yawl parallel to the beach with a low-toned
word to his oarsmen, and the boat drifted slowly past
our hiding place, as if its crew might be scanning
the forest fringe for some determining landmark.</p>

<p>"Seven of them," said Van Dyck, with his lips
at my ear. "At least one of them will stay by
the yawl when they land. That will cut the odds
down a bit, though I shouldn't mind if they'd
divide up a little evener."</p>

<p>I did not reply. My eyes were smarting painfully
from the sweat which was running down into
them, and I was trying to get clear vision enough
to enable me to distinguish between the figures in
the slowly drifting boat. Though I couldn't make
sure, I thought that the man at the yawl's tiller was
the ex-steward, Lequat.</p>

<p>A landing was made a little way down the beach
from us, in a small indentation too shallow to be
called a bay. Noiselessly the yawl's oars were unshipped,
and then we heard the gentle grating of
the boat's keel upon the sand. In the debarking
it became apparent that Bonteck had considerably
underrated the caution of the invaders. Three of
the men stayed by the yawl, leaving only four for
whatever landward expedition was toward. Oddly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
enough, as we thought, the four did not make
directly for the glade where the gold had been
hidden. Instead, they moved off down the beach,
marching silently in single file and keeping well
within the shadow of the wood.</p>

<p>It was Van Dyck who flung a guess at their
intention.</p>

<p>"They are going to take a look-in at our camp,
first&mdash;to get the lay of the land and to make sure
that they won't be interrupted," he hazarded, adding:
"Which simplifies matters somewhat. The
farther they get away from their boat and the
yacht, the easier it will be for us to clap an extinguisher
upon them without giving the alarm. Let's
run for it and head them off!"</p>

<p>It seemed easy enough to make a quick detour
through the forest to a point at which we could
lie in wait for the marching four, and it was not
until after we had begun it that we realized how
dark it was under the trees, and how much the
darkness was going to cut our speed. A few minutes
of this woodland race proved enough for both
of us. "Head for the beach and we'll run them
down in the open," was Van Dyck's modifying
order, after we had stumbled and fallen half a dozen
times and got ourselves well torn and stabbed by
the little bayonet palms that grew thickly among
the larger trees; and this we did, issuing from the
wood a hundred yards or so beyond the beached
yawl, and possibly a like distance behind the men
we were trying to overtake.</p>

<p>To chase the four men openly from that point
was to give the alarm in both directions at once;
in other words, to invite a front and rear attack
that we couldn't hope to repel with our primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
weapons. So we fell back into the wood, changing
our plan again and deciding to wait until the four
were out of sight, when we could turn and fall
upon the three at the boat and stand some chance
of overcoming them and possessing ourselves of
whatever arms they might have.</p>

<p>But even this alternative was to be denied us.
While we halted, breathing hard from the hot
struggle with the impeding jungle, Van Dyck said,
"Listen!" again. Afar to the eastward there was
a sound like the flapping of a thousand wings; a
low drumming that seemed to fill the dead air with
jarring vibrations and to play upon the senses with
the maddening insistence of a single musical note
too long sustained.</p>

<p>Before we had time to realize what the ominous
warning portended, a pistol shot cracked from the
<i>Andromeda's</i> bridge, and for a brief instant the blinding
glare of the searchlight swept the island beach.</p>

<p>"Calling them in," I said. "Whatever they're
minded to do, the storm is going to beat them to
it." And that the shot and flash were signals summoning
the boat's crew to come aboard was quickly
made apparent. The expeditionary four wheeled
and came running back along the beach, while
the three boat guards were tumbling hastily into
the yawl and shipping the oars.</p>

<p>Van Dyck gripped his club. "We mustn't let
them get away, or get together again!" he rapped
out. "Wait until I give the word!"&mdash;and as the
four runners were about to pass our hiding place&mdash;"Now!"</p>

<p>What I did had to be done on the spur of the
moment. At the climaxing instant, I flung my
arms around him and dragged him down and held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
him helpless; at which it was only natural that he
should fall to cursing me like a fishwife.</p>

<p>"You fool!" I panted, when I had the breath
to spare. "Let them go! They'll come back.
Don't you hear that wind coming? The yacht
will be lost if she hangs on outside of that reef five
minutes longer!"</p>

<p>As I let him get up, a hurtling volley of great
raindrops tore through the foliage over our heads,
and a blast, carrying with it the dank, unwholesome
breath of an upheaved watery underworld,
swept across the surface of the lagoon. Like mad-men
the racing four hurled themselves into the
waiting yawl, the boat shoved off, and with the men
at the oars pulling with much more energy than skill,
a frantic dash was made for the passage through
the reef.</p>

<p>It bade fair to be a shrewd case of touch and go;
an open question as to whether or not the yawl
could reach the yacht before the yacht would have
to claw off the island in sheer self-preservation.
Dark as it had grown, we could see the black smoke
of freshly fueled fires pouring from the <i>Andromeda's</i>
funnels to be caught up and whirled away
to leeward, and above the shrieking of the blast
we could hear the trampling chant of her powerful
engines. Whoever was in command was proving
himself a daring captain. With a Caribbean hurricane
fairly upon him, and a jagged reef lying
within a cable's length, he was backing and filling
and holding his ground stubbornly to give the yawl,
tossing now like a cockleshell on a heaving sea
which was already surging over the reef, time to
reach him.</p>

<p>Van Dyck burst out in an ecstasy of rage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Damn him!" he yelled, apostrophizing the
unknown manoeuverer on the <i>Andromeda's</i> bridge,
"he'll put the yacht on the rocks, and that'll be
the end of all of us!"</p>

<p>It certainly looked that way. More rain was
coming, not in huge drops, as at first, but in a
fine, mist-like spray, driving horizontally and
drenching instantly everything it touched. Though
the rising moon was completely blotted out by the
rain and the high cloud wrack, there was still light
enough in the open to enable us to see the <i>Andromeda</i>
and the yawl. The returning boat's crew
seemed fully alive to the need for haste; the men
at the oars were splashing mightily and digging
deep. But enthusiasm, even the enthusiasm of fear,
is but a poor substitute for mariner skill. The little
boat had safely negotiated the dangerous reef
passage and was half-way out to the yacht when an
oar broke, and it could have been only the cleverest
dexterity on the part of the helmsman that kept
the yawl from falling into the trough of the rising
seas and capsizing when the man at the broken
oar tumbled over backward and so crippled for
the moment the remainder of the yawl's motive
power.</p>

<p>But the small accident settled matters definitely
for the yacht's captain, whoever he was. As if
the snapping ash had been the signal for which
he was waiting&mdash;and a convincing proof that it
was no use for him to wait any longer&mdash;he called
for full speed ahead, jammed his helm hard down,
and with a lurch to port so abrupt that it seemed
as if it must surely put her upon her beam ends,
the <i>Andromeda</i> fled, vanishing like a white wraith
in the spume and smother to leeward, and leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the luckless landing party to do what it pleased, or
could, toward saving itself.</p>

<p>What the boat's steersman did&mdash;most naturally&mdash;was
to try to make land again. By some means
he got the disabled yawl around without swamping
it and headed it for the narrow reef passage which
was now all but hidden by the tumbling seas.
Badly handicapped as he was by the loss of one of
the four oars, it still seemed as if he might make the
inlet. Steered as fine as a racing shell rounding the
turning buoy, the light little craft leaped for the
opening. But at the balancing instant, when
another tug at the oars might have sent it through
into the comparatively calmer waters of the lagoon,
the yawl was caught on the lift of a billow, flung
aside like a bit of driftwood, and dropped with a
crash of splintering timbers on the rocks.</p>

<p>Under the conditions&mdash;a tropical hurricane coming
on apace, seas dashing over a half-submerged
coral reef, and their boat reduced to kindling wood&mdash;all
seven of the mutineers, pirates, gold-robbers,
or whatever they were, should have been swept
away and drowned as we looked. At first we
thought that was what had happened&mdash;was necessarily
bound to happen. And it apparently did
happen to two of the seven. For a moment later,
when we saw bobbing heads dotting the heaving
swells in the lagoon, we could count but five, and
there were only five sodden figures to come crawling
out a bit later, one after another, upon the beach.
Van Dyck stooped and picked up his club, which
he had dropped in the excitement of watching the
struggles of the swimmers.</p>

<p>"Dick, it's murder, and in cold blood .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but
we can't let those men run loose on the island.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
We'll be starving presently, and so will they. Are
you with me?"</p>

<p>I suppose he took my answer for granted, for
he started to run toward the group of wearied
swimmers, and I ran with him. As he had said,
it was a good bit like murder. Two of the exhausted
ones were too far gone to make any attempt
at resistance; they merely rolled over on their
faces on the sand, spreading their arms wide in
token of surrender.</p>

<p>But the three others, with Lequat to head them,
did their best. Pistols cracked, and in the fray I
got a kick, delivered after the best manner of the
French foot-boxer, that nearly knocked the breath
out of me. But we were fresh, and the three were
practically in the last ditch of exhaustion when
we fell upon them. So long as the pistols were
fired without aim, there could be but one issue to
the hand-to-hand battle. When it was over, the
three fighting men were groveling with the others,
two of them with cracked heads and the other with
a crippled wrist to his firing hand.</p>

<p>Van Dyck was as ruthless in victory as he had
been in the attack.</p>

<p>"Search them!" he ordered, and like a pair
of highwaymen we went through the pockets of
the vanquished boat's crew. Three pistols, two of
them modern automatics, and one an old-fashioned
Navy weapon, a couple of murderous knives, and
a few cartridges comprised the loot; these, and a
coil of light line which one of the men had wound
around his body&mdash;for what object we didn't inquire.
But the rope came in play handily. With it, while
the increasing gale tore savagely at us, we bound the
captives hand and foot, and dragged them one by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
one up into the wood; and the transfer was not
made any too quickly, at that, for by now the
great seas were leaping the barrier reef to come
rushing down the lagoon upon the unprotected
beach.</p>

<p>It seemed horribly cruel to leave five men, three
of them pretty sorely wounded, to lie bound and
helpless under the palms and wholly at the mercy
of the storm, but self-preservation knows no law.
Van Dyck put the constraining necessity tersely
when he said, shouting to make himself heard above
the din and clamor of the elements: "That's all we
can do here, and we're needed at the other end of
things. This gale will be ripping our camp up by
the roots."</p>

<p>Together we turned our backs upon the prisoners
and started toward our own end of the island. The
beach was by this time quite impassable. Huge
seas were leaping the reef to hurl themselves in
thunder crashings far up into the fringing wood. So
we were forced to strike off diagonally inland, feeling
our way blindly from tree to tree, and judging the
direction only by keeping the wind at our backs.
Even so, we were unable to hold anything like a
straight course. Once we came out upon the south
beach, and were well battered and bruised and all
but drowned before we could claw back to the
partial shelter of the jungle. Farther on we were
lost again, and this time we stumbled out upon
the north beach somewhere between the bay of
the Spanish wreck and our camp. Over this lagoon
frontage, like that on the south shore, the sea was
running in huge billows, clearing the outer barrier
as if it were not there, and the pounding crashes
seemed to shake the small island to its foundations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>As was to be expected, we found a most pitiable
state of affairs at the camp when we finally won
through. The fire had been drowned in the first
downpour of the rain, and the small clearing was
in murky darkness. Two of the tents had been
blown down, and the third, into which the women
were crowded, was straining at the peg ropes.
Worse still, there was no longer any beach, with its
stretch of sand, to fence off the sea. The conditions
as we had found them farther to the eastward
were repeated at the camp site, only they were
worse, if anything. The great seas, rolling down
the lagoon at a sharp angle with the shore line,
were flinging their spray high over the small
clearing, each upsweeping surge giving us notice
that its follower was likely to engulf us.</p>

<p>It was in such a crisis as this that Van Dyck
showed at his best as a man and a leader. Before
I had had time to wipe the salt spray out of my
eyes he had gathered the available men of the
party and was energetically at work moving the
camp back into the most sheltered of the inland
glades. By heroic battlings, in which even Holly
Barclay and the major bore a part, we got the two
dismantled tents set up in the new location. It
was in the transferring of the women that I became
a deserter. Miss Mehitable Gilmore, with the
dragoness outer shell all cracked and broken to
reveal a very human and distracted old woman
beneath it, was calling piteously for Conetta.</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard Preble&mdash;find her&mdash;find her!" she
gasped. "She's gone and she'll be drowned&mdash;I
know she'll be drowned!"</p>

<p>A hurried question or two elicited the alarming
facts. Billy Grisdale and Edith Van Tromp had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
not come in from their post at the western signal
point, and Conetta had flown to warn them. That
was enough for me. With a blunt word to Van
Dyck, I deserted.</p>

<p>It was only a short quarter of a mile to the western
extremity of the island, and I covered it in a
stumbling rush, with the wind knocking me down
and forcing me to scramble on hands and knees
when it got a fair sweep at me. Reaching the point
where we had built our fire and flown our distress
signal from the lopped palm, nothing was recognizable
in the darkness, but as nearly as I could make
out, the tree was gone and the breakers were
running man-head deep over the place where the
fire had been. I had a bad minute or two until I
had shouted and groped around and found the three
missing ones crouching in the shelter of the nearest
jungle growth. It had been horribly easy to fancy
them blown into the sea from the bare sandspit.</p>

<p>Billy was doing his best, as any one who knew
him would have predicted. He had wattled the
bushes together behind the two women, and had
stripped off his coat to add it to the shelter. Nevertheless,
he made no secret of his relief when he
heard my shout at his ear.</p>

<p>"By Jove," he choked; "misery likes company,
you know. Cuddle down here, Uncle Dick, and
tell us we're only dreaming when we think we're
soaked to the skin. A little more and I believe it
would really make up its mind to rain! What's
the show for getting back to camp? I couldn't
do it with two of 'em&mdash;tried it and we all came near
being washed away."</p>

<p>"No show at all at present; we'll have to wait
a bit," I said; and then I took my part in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
sheltering. In the dash from the dismantled camp
I had caught up a square of canvas that had
served as part of a tent fly, and with Grisdale's
help, it was rigged as a sort of rain break to windward.</p>

<p>"I knew you'd come," said Conetta quite calmly,
when there was nothing more to do or to be done,
and the four of us were cowering under the canvas.
And then, with the calmness somewhat shaken:
"The others? Are they all alive?"</p>

<p>"Alive and unhurt, so far as I could tell in the
dark," I hastened to say. "They are moving the
camp back into the wood. Ingerson was the only
one who was missing."</p>

<p>"What has become of him?"</p>

<p>I didn't tell her that Van Dyck and I had left
him asleep under the trees on the north shore of
the island some two hours earlier. It didn't seem
at all necessary to harrow her with the story
of Ingerson's miring in the drink demoniac's
morass.</p>

<p>"I don't know just what has become of him," I
said, which was strictly true as to the bare fact.
"He'll doubtless turn up all right in the morning."</p>

<p>"You say they are moving the camp. Will it
be safer in the wood?"</p>

<p>"There was no choice. The seas are breaking
over the other place by now."</p>

<p>"Poor Aunt Mehitable!" she said brokenly. "At
the very first lull we must go back to her, Dick."</p>

<p>"There is no special hurry," I offered. "She is
all right, and she sent me out to find you; begged
me to go."</p>

<p>"She sent you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; me, and not Jerry Dupuyster."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>There was silence for a little time; such silence
as the shrieks of the hurricane and the crashing of
the seas permitted. Then she said drearily: "We
can't go back and begin all over again, you and I,
Richard. It's too late, now."</p>

<p>Most naturally, I could take this declaration
only in one sense. She had admitted that Jerry
had asked her to marry him, and her saying that it
was too late was merely an indirect way of telling
me that she was promised to him. And that
thought set me boiling inwardly again. For in the
hubbub of camp moving Jerry had been doing his
impractical best to shelter Beatrice Van Tromp;
this when he must have known that Conetta was
somewhere out in the storm.</p>

<p>"I shall have a good-sized bone to pick with
Jerry, if we ever get back to normal again," I
said, and because I didn't take the trouble to try
to whisper the threat, Edie Van Tromp cut in.</p>

<p>"Stop it, you two!" she commanded. "I can't
hear what you're saying, but I know you are quarreling."</p>

<p>Billy Grisdale groaned. "If I only had my mandolin!"
he lamented. "Get down, Tige"&mdash;this to
the bull pup who was trying to climb into his
master's lap for better protection from the storm.
And then to me: "How long do these little summer
sprinkles last, Uncle Dick?"</p>

<p>I declined to commit myself, It didn't strike me
as a Christian thing to do to make the women more
miserable by telling them that the storm might
last for days, and that our best hope was for a
cessation of the pouring rain floods.</p>

<p>As it turned out, in this one respect we were
favored. After about an hour the rain was coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
only in driving squalls and the thick darkness
was a little broken. Overhead the moon showed
faintly through the masses of cloud wrack hurling
themselves westward on the high crest of the gale,
and there was a pallid promise of a clearing sky.</p>

<p>But with the ceasing of the downpour the wind
increased to hurricane fury, and the pounding of
the seas upon the reef and upon the island itself
was like a succession of earthquake shocks. As far
as our limited range of vision could reach, the sea
was heaving and tossing in mountain-like billows
with valleys between in which the tallest ship would
have been hidden, and it was plainly evident that a
new danger was threatening. Our island was low
and flat; in its highest spots it was scarcely more
than eight or ten feet above the normal sea level.
If the gale should blow long enough and hard
enough, it could be only a question of time until
the catapulting seas would break down the jungle
barriers and sweep the island from end to end.</p>

<p>"Time for us to move!" Grisdale sang out, as a
particularly vicious "seventh wave" broke just behind
us and reached for our shelter spot in its tumultuous
torrenting across the sands; and we took the
hint.</p>

<p>"You two fight for yourselves," I called back,
and the battle with the pouring gale was begun.</p>

<p>It was a battle royal. For every foot of the
quarter mile we had to fight desperately. Even
in the wood it was impossible at times to stand
against the wind, and again and again we had to
fling ourselves prone, clinging to whatever hold
offered itself. And at every step the palm fronds
above our heads were crackling and snapping like
whips, and the air was full of flying missiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>We held together for the better part of the time,
Grisdale and Edie locking arms and facing the
blasts in the fresh strength of youth and health,
and taking their buffetings with a laugh. So battling
and creeping by turns, we came at last to
the breathless home stretch, and I was unspeakably
relieved to find the white tents still standing intact
in the glade which Van Dyck had chosen for their
latest pitching place.</p>

<p>"Keep your good nerve just a few minutes
longer," I said to Conetta, who was clinging to
me with a grip that I think no hurricane blast
could have broken. "We are almost there."</p>

<p>I had a glimpse in the starlight of her face upturned
to mine, and saw her lips move as if in
reply. But what she was saying I did not hear.
For at that moment one of the flying missiles&mdash;it
was a broken tree-top, they told me afterward&mdash;came
between and blotted me out.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>




<h2>XIV<br />
<br />
<small>HAND TO MOUTH</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> blow from the broken tree-top must have
been a fairly forceful one. When I began to get
acquainted with current affairs again, I was lying
in a hammock swung between two trees, the gale
had blown itself out, and the sun was shining.</p>

<p>At a little distance I could see the tents of the
new camp, but there seemed to be nobody stirring.
Overhead the bedraggled fronds of the palms were
waving in a gentle breeze aftermath of the great
storm, and the thunder of the surf on the reef told
me that the sea had not yet fully subsided.</p>

<p>I moved a bit and put a leg over the hammock's
edge, meaning to get up, but at that, Van Dyck
materialized from somewhere and put the leg back
again.</p>

<p>"No hurry about turning out, old man," he said
gently. "How are you feeling by now?"</p>

<p>I took stock of myself and answered accordingly.</p>

<p>"Head feeling as big as a bushel basket, but I'm
otherwise normal, I guess. What happened to
me?"</p>

<p>He told me about the crack on the head from the
falling tree-top. "You were knocked out by the
blow, and when you came to, you were wandering
a bit in your mind and talked too much. It was
making it rather awkward for Conetta&mdash;the things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
you were saying&mdash;so I took the liberty of giving
you a small sleeping-shot with the emergency
needle."</p>

<p>"Thanks," I yawned. "The next thing to being
able to do a good turn for yourself is to have a kind
friend at your elbow to do it for you. I feel as
though I had slept the clock around. What makes
it so quiet?"</p>

<p>"Nobody at home," he answered evasively. "Professor
Sanford has formed a class in natural science,
and it is out doing field stunts."</p>

<p>"Otherwise?" I queried.</p>

<p>"Otherwise foraging for breakfast. It has come,
Dick. We didn't get action swiftly enough last
night to save the few provisions there were left in
the commissary, and the seas made a clean sweep.
Tell me a few of the natural-history things that
you and the other survivors of the <i>Mary Jane</i>
must have learned while you were trying to keep from
starving to death after your shipwreck."</p>

<p>I closed my eyes and took the needful plunge
into the dismal memories.</p>

<p>"There were always the cocoanuts, of course&mdash;and
I've never been able to abide the taste of one
since. Then there is, or was, a kind of oyster, too
big to be eatable unless you were powerfully hungry.
We got them by wading in the lagoon shallows.
There are plenty of crabs, as you know; they
would probably be good if they were cooked. But
we of the <i>Mary Jane</i> had no fire. The lagoon is
full of fish; some good for food, and some deadly.
You try them and if you survive they are all right.
If you don't survive, they are poisonous."</p>

<p>"How did you catch the fish?" Van Dyck wanted
to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>"We didn't catch many of them. A diet of raw
fish doesn't appeal very strongly unless one is
nearer starvation than we could be while the cocoanuts
lasted."</p>

<p>"No edible roots?"</p>

<p>"None that we ever discovered; and, anyway,
they wouldn't have been edible raw. But, say;
we're missing something. How about those trussed-up
pirates? Won't the professor's natural-science
class stumble upon them and have a shock?"</p>

<p>At this question Van Dyck looked a trifle foolish.</p>

<p>"I thought we tied those fellows securely enough
last night," he offered. "Didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I did, indeed. Are you trying to tell me that
they've picked the locks?"</p>

<p>"They are not where we left them; that is one
sure thing. I went out there early this morning,
meaning to make them talk and tell me what's
what on the <i>Andromeda</i>. They had disappeared."</p>

<p>"They are loose on the island?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"That would be the natural inference, you'd say.
But I couldn't find any trace of them&mdash;haven't yet
found any."</p>

<p>"Then the <i>Andromeda</i> must have come back to
take them off."</p>

<p>Van Dyck's eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't go so far as to say that it is impossible.
But the seas are still running pretty high,
and if the yacht's people were able to make a landing
with either of the power launches before dawn,
they are better sailormen than I've been giving
them credit for being."</p>

<p>"They'd come back for their men if it were
humanly possible," I ventured, "and they might
have good hopes of being able to find them alive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
The wreck of the yawl happened after the yacht
had disappeared, you remember. But if they did
come back, how about the treasure trove? Would
they go away again without digging up your plantation?
But perhaps they did dig it up?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"No; that is the first thing I thought of when
the five men turned up missing. The block of
coral is just where we left it. Nothing has been
disturbed."</p>

<p>"But if that is what the landing party came for
last night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know; it's a mystery, but in the heart of it
lies our best hope, I believe. They meant to dig
when they made that landing last night. I found
a shovel this morning. In their hurry to get away,
the yawl crew left it on the beach and the seas had
washed it up under the trees."</p>

<p>"Whereabouts is the hope?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"It is all guess-work," he admitted. "Assuming
that they came last night to dig&mdash;and didn't dig&mdash;and
assuming again that they came back in the
dark hour before dawn, and still didn't dig, it is
a fair inference that we haven't seen the last of
the <i>Andromeda</i>&mdash;or isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," I said. "The plot has grown
much too complicated for me. Meanwhile, I suppose
we ought to be thankful that we haven't five
additional mouths to fill&mdash;with nothing to fill them
with. You wouldn't have let those five pirates
starve, would you, Bonteck?"</p>

<p>The look that came into his eyes was handsomely
gloomy.</p>

<p>"I meant to come just as near doing it as I
could, and get by without serving a sentence for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
manslaughter." And with that, he pulled his cap
over his eyes and walked away, coming back presently
with a still gloomier look in his eyes.</p>

<p>"It's hell, Dick," he broke out grittingly. "I've
got to tell these people of ours what's been done to
them. It is the least I can do now. There is
starvation just ahead of us; and from what we
saw last night, it is perfectly plain that if the
<i>Andromeda</i> comes back, it won't be for the purpose
of taking us off."</p>

<p>"Not to take us off, perhaps, but the other
motive&mdash;the motive that brought her here last
night&mdash;still exists. If she came to dig up your
buried 'ammunition' which has so mysteriously disappeared,
she will come again. You may depend
upon that."</p>

<p>"Just the same, I've got to tell them," he said
doggedly, going back to the conscientious part of
it; adding: "And I'd much rather be shot. It
was such an asinine thing, even as I had it shaped
up in the beginning. How can I ever make it appear
to them as it appeared to me?&mdash;as a harmless little
practical joke, with no particular sting in its tail?
In the light of what has happened, I can never
hope to make it look that way; not even to you or
to Madeleine, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>I rose upon an elbow.</p>

<p>"Why not wait a little longer?" I argued.
"The <i>Andromeda</i> will surely turn up again, and
when she does, it will be up to us to recapture her
at all hazards. When that is done, you can tell
the others, if you still think it necessary."</p>

<p>"But I owe it to you, at least, to tell them now."</p>

<p>"Why to me, especially?"</p>

<p>"For Conetta's sake."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll answer for Conetta."</p>

<p>He sat down on the biscuit box, where he had
been sitting when I came awake, and put his back
against a tree.</p>

<p>"I'm a wholesale murderer, Dick; that is about
what it comes to!" he groaned. "I have brought
the woman I'd die for down into this devil's sea
to starve her to death. I know you'll say that I
meant it all the other way about, and so I did. But
in this world it is only results that count. I'm
a bloody assassin."</p>

<p>I tried sitting up in the hammock, and found that
it could be done. Then I tried standing, and found
that this, too, was possible.</p>

<p>"Supposing we go and join the breakfast chase,"
I suggested, meaning to interpose a saving distraction;
and we did it.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of the fourth act&mdash;the
most disheartening fourth act&mdash;in our gladsome
little Caribbean comedy which was turning out so
tragically. For a day or two we were able to make
light of the sudden change of diet, and even of its
scantiness, and to extract some sort of forced fun
out of the oyster dredging and the crabbing; also,
out of our not too successful attempts to vary the
menu by fishing, with bent hat-pins for hooks, in
the crystal-clear waters of the lagoon. But in a
short while the laugh came less readily, and the
eyes of some&mdash;of the younger women, at least&mdash;grew
strained from much staring at dazzling, but
empty, horizons, and filled easily with tears.</p>

<p>Yet, on the whole, the revelation of inner egos
brought about by this face-to-face fronting of a
desperate extremity was not disappointing.
Stripped now of all the maskings of make-believe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
we saw one another as we were, and much that had
been hidden was found to be heart-mellowing and
even inspiring when it was dragged out into the
unsparing light of a common disaster.</p>

<p>The courage of the women, in particular, was the
finest thing imaginable. There were nine of them
starving heroically with us, and they were doing it
with a measure of cheer that was beyond all praise.
Even Miss Mehitable refused to figure as an exception.
"We must be good losers," she said to
Conetta and me one evening when we were trying
to tempt her with a bit of broiled fish without
seasoning. And she did not resent it when Alicia
Van Tromp, thrusting a laughing face in at the
open tent flap, called her "a dear, dead-game old
sport."</p>

<p>For the men there is less to be said; partly because
it is a man's job to endure hardness anyway,
and partly because three of our nine were not
living up to their privileges. Ingerson was doing a
little better, to be sure; for one thing, he was no
longer thrusting himself upon Madeleine. During
the night of the hurricane he had lain out in all
the fury of it, and possibly the pouring deluge had
washed some of the brute out of him. At all
events, he was less obnoxious, holding himself aloof
in a half-surly way, and seeming&mdash;or so we hoped&mdash;to
be fighting a morose battle with his appetite.
Once, when I spoke of his changed attitude to
Conetta, she quoted Scripture at me: "'This kind
goeth not out but by fasting and prayer.' I doubt
if he is praying much, but he is certainly fasting."</p>

<p>Major Terwilliger, on the other hand, grew even
more contemptible as the pinch nipped the harder.
Ranging the island for edible things, as we all did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
he discovered a wild mango in bearing, and though
the fruit would have been a grateful boon to all as
a change, he kept the discovery to himself for two
whole days before Billy Grisdale, who was trailing
him, made him give up and share what was left on
the tree. Holly Barclay had given up his pretense
of illness and was less exacting than before; but
he was still utterly useless in any practical way.</p>

<p>During this interval, in which we were maintaining
night and day watches and patrolling the
beaches, Bonteck was still holding his peace as I had
counseled him to, though I could see that his load
was growing heavier day by day. As to the events
of the hurricane night, it was by agreement that
no mention of the <i>Andromeda's</i> visit had been
made to the others. This was Bonteck's idea.
Since nothing had come of the yacht's return and
our adventure with the five men who had so
mysteriously disappeared, he argued that no good
could result from spreading the news; that the
news couldn't well be spread without adding explanations
which I, myself, had advised him to
withhold.</p>

<p>It was a week, or perhaps a day or so more than
that, after the night of alarms that Van Dyck took
me aside and showed me a piece of light rope such
as is used for signal halliards on board ship; a
piece, I said, but I should have said two short
pieces tied together in a hard knot.</p>

<p>"Do you recognize it?" he asked.</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"Of course, I couldn't swear to it," he said, "but
it looks like a bit of the flag halliards from the
yacht. In other words, a bit of the rope with which
we tied the five pirates."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well?" I queried.</p>

<p>"I forgot to say that when I went to look for
those fellows the next morning, I didn't find any
of these rope lashings. They didn't leave even that
much of a trace of themselves when they made off."</p>

<p>"Well?" I said again.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are pretty well convinced by this
time that the <i>Andromeda</i> came back and took them
off, and so am I. Taking that view of it, you'll
know what it means when I tell you that I found
this piece of knotted rope in the bushes a few yards
from our camp&mdash;lost out of somebody's pocket, for
a guess."</p>

<p>Truly, I did know. It meant that the <i>Andromeda</i>
had come a second time, and that, in addition to
rescuing the survivors of the yawl's crew, the
rescuing party had crept up upon us; had been near
enough to massacre the lot of us as we slept after
the strenuous exertions of the forepart of the
night.</p>

<p>"Um," said I; "why didn't they kill us all off
while the killing was good? Perhaps you can answer
me that."</p>

<p>"There may have been reasons. Possibly the
landing party&mdash;the second one&mdash;wasn't big enough
to attempt it with safety. Besides, what was the
use of their troubling themselves when the lapse of
a little time would take the job off their hands?"</p>

<p>Here was a ready explanation for all that had
happened, or hadn't happened, since the night of
the storm. The mutineers were merely giving us
time to starve to death. Their spying expedition
had doubtless shown them that our stores were
gone, and they could easily argue that in a few
days we, too, would be gone&mdash;at least gone past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the point at which we could interfere with anything
they wished to do on the island.</p>

<p>It was on a crabbing expedition when, as it
chanced, I was paired with the youngest of the
Van Tromp trio, that Edith asked a question which
I knew must be trembling continually upon the lips
of every woman in our forlorn company.</p>

<p>"How long can it last, Uncle Dick? How long
can we live on just cocoanuts and hope, after the
horrid great oysters are all gone, and these creepy,
leggy crabs have grown too cunning to let us
catch them?"</p>

<p>"We must try not to dwell upon that," I told
her. "Our problem is to live from day to day."</p>

<p>"But there will come a day," she asserted. "I
can see it in Billy's eyes, when I can get him to
look at me."</p>

<p>"Ouch!" I said, purposely letting a crab nip
my finger for the sake of making a diversion. But
the tribe to which Miss Edith belongs rejoices in
its ability to cling, limpet-like, to a matter in hand.</p>

<p>"The Caribs were cannibals, weren't they?&mdash;in
the long ago?" she went on. "Are we coming to
that, Richard Preble? If we should, Billy and I
will draw straws. We're both young and tender,
you know."</p>

<p>"Hush!" I commanded; "that isn't a pretty
joke." And later that same day, when I was able
to get hold of Billy Grisdale, I read the riot act to
him.</p>

<p>"You want to rub the O-Lord-pity-us look out of
your eyes, young man, and put a little more ginger
into your conversation with Edie," I suggested.
"She is beginning to see things in the back part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
your brain, and that isn't good for little girl
Crusoes."</p>

<p>"Take it to yourself!" he retorted spitefully.
"I saw you looking at Conetta not fifteen minutes
ago with a scare in your eyes big enough to set
an innocent bystander's teeth on edge."</p>

<p>"I'll reform," I promised, "and so must you,
Billy. Take Bonteck for your model; not me."</p>

<p>"Bonteck's got something up his sleeve," he said
morosely. "He's been going through the bunch
for weapons. Think of it&mdash;nine men of us here
three thousand miles out of reach of a policeman,
and not so much as one poor little potato-popgun
among us."</p>

<p>This was a mistake on Billy's part, of course.
We still had the three pistols taken from the men
we had waylaid on the night of the storm, but of
these no mention had been made to Billy or any
of the others, since to speak of them would have
called for the story of the night's adventures&mdash;a
story which Van Dyck and I were still keeping to
ourselves.</p>

<p>But Billy's remark about the inquiry for weapons
was news of a sort. Had Van Dyck caught a fresh
glimpse of the <i>Andromeda's</i> smoke plume on the
horizon he was always sweeping with the field-glass?</p>

<p>"Bonteck wasn't trying to disarm anybody, was
he?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. He talked sort of vaguely about a
scrap of some kind, and being prepared for it;
wanted to know if the professor and Grey and
Dupuyster and I would put ourselves under orders,
and do what he might tell us to, sight unseen.
Said maybe he'd be able to explain more fully a
little later on."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>I thought I saw what was in Van Dyck's mind.
His secret was gnawing the life out of him, and,
sooner or later, it would have to come out. I knew
well enough that he was not hesitating from any
cowardly motive; it was rather because I had urged
him to wait, holding out the hope that a more
auspicious time for the telling of the plot would
come&mdash;or at least that a less auspicious time than
this starvation period could hardly come.</p>

<p>In the waiting interval, and as in some sense
still our host and leader, he had been obliged to
busy himself with something, and apart from the
daily effort to make the hardships less grinding
upon all of us, and the women in particular, he
had organized the six of us men who were willing
into four-hour watches of two men each to patrol
the two beaches, urging our daily decreasing food
supply as a reason for the increased vigilance, and
insisting that we must not allow the smallest chance
of discovery to escape us. If a ship were sighted
in the night, the two watchers making the discovery
were to arouse the other four instantly, and
without giving a general alarm.</p>

<p>Though he had not confided it to me in detail,
his plan was obvious enough. He was still expecting
another return of the <i>Andromeda</i>, and was determined
to make a desperate effort to regain possession
of the yacht when the chance should offer.
For this attempt, hazardous as it would surely prove
to be, he could count definitely upon only six of our
nine. Barclay was certainly out of it, and the major's
age exempted him. Ingerson was a doubtful
quantity&mdash;very doubtful from my point of view&mdash;and
I questioned if Van Dyck would call upon him or
make him a party to any plan that might be determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
upon when the time for action should arrive.
Still, outnumbered as we must be, a recapture of
the yacht appeared to be our only hope. We might
all starve a thousand times over before any chance
ship should sight our isolated island; sight it and
approach near enough to make out our distress
signals.</p>

<p>Just how much or how little Van Dyck would
confess to the others, if a time should come when
he would no longer be able to keep silence, was a
question that was puzzling me. To tell the assembled
castaways that there had probably been a
real mutiny where only a sham one was intended
would cut no figure as news, since sixteen of our
eighteen already believed it to have been real.
That being the case, the only encouraging thing to
be revealed was the burial of the golden hoard,
and the reasonable hope it gave us that the <i>Andromeda</i>
would come back, sooner or later, in order to
search for it.</p>

<p>As to this, however, I was quite confident that
Bonteck would never go so far as to tell the others
about the gold planting. That he would publish
the bald truth about his generous and lover-like
little plot, the object of which was to enable Madeleine
Barclay to buy her freedom of choice in
matters matrimonial, was simply unthinkable. And
if the gold-burying episode were to be left out of
his confession, in what other manner could he
account to the others for his belief that the yacht
would eventually return?</p>

<p>As it came about, the answers to all these questioning
reflections were already marshaling themselves
for a descent upon us at the moment when I
was undertaking to show Billy Grisdale that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
man's eyes should be kept decently shuttered when
his brain is conjuring up pictures of the terrible
things that may happen to the loved one.</p>

<p>On this same evening Professor Sanford and I
were paired to take the first watch for the patrolling
of the beach, and at eight o'clock we set out from
the camp in the glade, leaving the other members
of our Crusoe company sitting around the dying
embers of the cooking fire. Following the regular
sentry-go routine, Sanford and I parted at the
camp; he was to take the south beach and I the
north, and we were to meet at the sandspit in which
the island terminated to the eastward. As I tramped
along upon my solitary watch round I was sorrier
than ever for Van Dyck. All that day he had been
going about like a man with a dozen murders on
his conscience, and it was plain to be seen that each
added day&mdash;days in which he was obliged to see
some of us actually going hungry because we hadn't
been able to gather enough to satisfy eighteen
normal and healthy appetites&mdash;was crowding him
nearer to the brink of the humiliating confession
chasm. From advising him not to tell, I was coming
around to the opposite point of view and wishing
that I hadn't tried to stop him. As matters stood,
he was like a man facing a deferred surgical operation.
It was true, the operation might prove fatal;
but there were opportunities for the dying of any
number of anticipatory deaths during the interval
of suspense.</p>

<p>Skirting the northern edge of the island without
seeing anything to mar the mirror-like surface of
the starlit sea, I was first at the sandspit rendezvous
by a good half-hour. Since there was no reason
for haste, and the sandy cape commanded a wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
view of the watery waste in all directions save one,
I filled my pipe with the final shakings of my last
sack of tobacco, and after poking in the ashes of
the neglected signal fire and finding no live coals
among them, I lighted the pipe with one of the
few precious matches we were hoarding, and sat
down on the sands to wait. In due course of time
the professor appeared, a dark figure trudging along
aimlessly; and when he came nearer I saw that he
had his hands clasped behind him and was walking
with his head down like a person buried in the
deepest thought&mdash;the very antitype of an alert
coast guardsman on the watch for a sail. When he
descried me he came over and sat down beside me,
still thoughtfully abstracted.</p>

<p>"I was beginning to wonder what had become of
you, Professor," I said, merely to start things going.</p>

<p>"Yes; I was detained. Mr. Van Dyck called
me back shortly after you left," he explained half-absently.
Then he opened up: "Mr. Preble, I
have been listening to a most astounding&mdash;er&mdash;confession,
I suppose you might call it. I wonder
if you know what it is?"</p>

<p>"I do," I answered shortly. "Van Dyck has
been telling you that a harmless little comedy
planned by him to break the monotony of our cruise
has turned into a potential tragedy, with all the
attendant hardships and horrors."</p>

<p>"You are quite right. He was very manly about
it, and he blames himself unsparingly. It was an
exceedingly difficult thing for him to do&mdash;to tell us
of it. He realized fully that the present conditions
must make any explanation seem wretchedly inadequate."</p>

<p>"They do," I agreed, and then I asked the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
burning question: "The others, Professor Sanford?
How did they take it?"</p>

<p>"A-a-hem-hem&mdash;h'm; each after his or her
kind, Mr. Preble. The women are pretty generally
sympathetic. They see only the immense responsibility
which Mr. Van Dyck freely acknowledges,
and are very humanly and generously sorry for
him. I wish I might say as much for the men. Grey
and young Grisdale are both loyal, though it was
plainly evident that Grey had to fight for his
loyalty, since the unhappy outcome involves his
wife. Ingerson talked and acted like a surly
ruffian, as you would imagine; and Major Terwilliger's
language was scarcely less reprehensible.
Dupuyster played the man. He rebuked his uncle
quite sharply and went across to grip Van Dyck's
hand and to say what a manly fellow might say in
the circumstances. And Miss Van Tromp&mdash;the
second Miss Van Tromp&mdash;went with him."</p>

<p>"Of course," I said crustily&mdash;and made another
mark on the score that I meant to settle with one
Gerald Dupuyster if we should ever attain to a
time when personal scores could be audited and
settled. Then I reminded the professor that he had
omitted Mr. Holly Barclay.</p>

<p>"I wish to continue omitting him," was the reply,
and the professor's tone was a measure of his disgust.
"Let it be sufficient to say that he made his
daughter blush for very shame with his puerile
accusations. He even went so far as to intimate
that Mr. Van Dyck was not telling the truth;
that the entire affair was a deep-laid plot designed
to involve Miss Madeleine in some way."</p>

<p>"That was to be expected&mdash;from Holly Barclay,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
I said. "But you are omitting one more: Professor
Abner Sanford, Ph. D."</p>

<p>I was relighting my pipe with another of the
precious matches, and in the momentary flare the
professor's plain-song face revealed itself. There
was a half-quizzical smile wrinkling at the corners
of the quiet gray eyes.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sanford and I are Mr. Van Dyck's guests,"
he qualified. "But, apart from that, I was content
to wait and hear what might develop further. As
it appears, Mr. Van Dyck has not entirely lost
hope. If there were a real mutiny&mdash;and, indeed,
there seems little doubt of that&mdash;Van Dyck still
has confidence in the resourcefulness of Goff, the
sailing-master. He insists that, sooner or later, the
<i>Andromeda</i> will return."</p>

<p>In the little interval of silence that followed I
was turning the professor's story over thoughtfully
in my mind. There had evidently been no mention
made of the gold-burying episode. Van Dyck had
dodged it very cleverly, it seemed, letting it be
understood that his hope of the yacht's return was
based upon the loyalty, in the last resort, of Elijah
Goff. It was better that way. So long as the hope
had been definitely held out to the others, there
was no need of terrifying the women by telling them
that if we should be lucky enough to regain our
ship it would be by hard knocks and a rather
forlorn-hope fight against overwhelming odds as to
numbers and arms.</p>

<p>"There is still one vote outstanding, Mr. Preble&mdash;your
own," said the professor, breaking into my
reverie.</p>

<p>"You have already taken that for granted,"
I returned. "If Bonteck had confided in me before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the fact&mdash;which I assure you he did not&mdash;I should
certainly have vetoed his plan for a fortnight's
picnic on this God-forsaken bit of coral in the
middle of nowhere. Yet, as his nearest friend, I
can understand, perhaps better than any one else,
why he was impelled to do it. Also, I can understand
that he had no reason whatever to foresee
the remotest possibility of any such tragic turn as
things have taken."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course; I think we shall all understand
that after we have duly weighed and considered."
The professor had locked his fingers over
his knees and was regarding me thoughtfully.
"Do you know," he went on, quite as if the main
problems had been worked out and definitely wiped
from the blackboard, "do you know, I am sometimes
a little regretful that I didn't learn to smoke
tobacco in my younger days? You gentlemen of
the pipe and cigar seem to get so much comfort out
of it."</p>

<p>"It is never too late to mend&mdash;or mar," I told
him; and with that we got up to resume our
respective sentry beats by which, under the established
routine, each of us would return to the camp
end of the island by the route over which the other
had come.</p>

<p>When we parted it was with the agreement to
meet again at the western extremity of the island,
and I ventured to call my watchmate's attention
to the fact that a lookout's duty was to look out.</p>

<p>"Why, bless me!&mdash;of course it is," he laughed.
"Now that you mention it, I remember that I
wasn't very faithful on the way over here. I'll
reform, Mr. Preble, I will, truly." And he went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
his way around the north beach toward the bay of
the galleon wreck.</p>

<p>It is probably a rare thing for a crisis in the affairs
of a group of nearly a score of people to turn upon
so trivial a matter as the tobacco habit. There was
still an unburned dottel in my pipe, and I could
not think of wasting it. If I had not stopped and
felt in my pockets for my one remaining match
while the professor was still a trudging shadow on
the white sands of the northern beach, the crisis
might have come and gone undiscovered by any
soul of our eighteen.</p>

<p>For, just as I had found the match and was in the
act of striking it, the ghost-like bulk of a ship loomed
silently in the starlight a short half-mile to the
eastward; a ship headed directly for the island and
showing no lights. It was the <i>Andromeda</i> again.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>




<h2>XV<br />
<br />
<small>THE MERRY WAR</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Putting</span> the unlighted match carefully away in
my pocket, I made a quick dash down the north
beach to overtake the professor.</p>

<p>I told him what I had seen, and he exclaimed,
"Dear me&mdash;you don't say so!" much as if I had
rushed up to assure him that the exact value of <i>pi</i>
in the circle-squaring problem had finally been
ascertained. And then, quite placidly: "What do
we do next, Mr. Preble?"</p>

<p>I didn't want to tell him that, in all probability,
the <i>Andromeda</i> mutineers were merely coming back
to dig for gold. That was still Van Dyck's personal
secret. But it was not difficult to convince him
that the yacht's errand was not friendly to us.</p>

<p>"They are creeping up quietly, at the wrong end
of the island, and with no lights showing," I pointed
out. "Which means that they are not coming to
take us off. If you will stay here and keep in touch
with them while I run back to camp and give the
alarm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly," he agreed. Then: "I'm not to show
myself?"</p>

<p>"By no manner of means. Don't let them see
you or hear you, but keep them in sight if you can
do it without exposing yourself. I shan't be gone
any longer than I can help."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the better part of a mile down the beach
to a point opposite the glade where our camp was
pitched, and the night was warm; but I took small
thought for either the distance or the heat. At
the camp everybody but Van Dyck had turned in;
at least, none of the others was in sight. Bonteck
was sitting beside the expiring embers of the bit of
cooking fire, with his head in his hands and his
gaze fixed upon the patch of white ashes with its
center spot of red coals.</p>

<p>I came up behind him, touched his shoulder, and
hastily whispered the news: "The <i>Andromeda</i> is
clawing up to the other end of the island just as
she did before&mdash;at half speed, and with no lights
showing."</p>

<p>"Thank God she is back at last!" he muttered,
starting up quickly. "It falls in at the right
minute, Dick. I was just saying to myself that
I'd go dippy if I couldn't fight somebody or something.
Turn out the squad, as quietly as you can."</p>

<p>Moving cautiously so as not to awaken any of
the non-combatants, I aroused Grey, Dupuyster and
Billy Grisdale and told them what was to the fore.
Van Dyck herded us quickly out of the camp circle,
and on the beach he groped under the palmettos
and uncovered our scanty arsenal; the three pistols
and the two knives we had taken from our former
captives. If our lately awakened recruits were
surprised at the appearance of the weapons they
said nothing, nor was there any comment made
when, out of the same hiding place, Bonteck drew
a half-dozen stout, serviceable clubs and distributed
them as he had the more modern weapons.</p>

<p>"Now then, if you are all ready," he said, giving
the word. "Set the pace, Dick, and we'll try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
keep up with you." And a moment later we were
running silently in single file along the north beach
toward the eastern-point lookout where I had
posted Sanford.</p>

<p>In making me the pace-setter, Bonteck builded
more wisely than he knew&mdash;more wisely than any of
us knew at the time. Having just completed a
mile dash at the best speed I could compass, I was
fain to set an easy dog-trot for the return, so we
were all comparatively fresh when we reached the
scene of action and found the professor.</p>

<p>Our lookout's report was brief and to the point.
The <i>Andromeda</i> had steamed up silently and was
lying off the south shore at no great distance from
us, and as yet there was no movement aboard; at
least, the professor said he hadn't been able to
see anything stirring on her decks. But Van Dyck,
making a hasty reconnaissance, came back with
better information.</p>

<p>"They are lowering the electric launch by hand,"
he announced. Then he outlined the situation for
us in a few brittle words. "You all understand, I
take it, that they have not come back&mdash;secretly,
this way&mdash;to rescue us. We may ignore their real
object for the present and come to the immediate
necessities. If we get possession of the yacht, we
shall doubtless have to fight for it."</p>

<p>"Just say when and how," Billy Grisdale cut in
tersely, trying the strength of his club over his
knee.</p>

<p>Van Dyck sketched his plan rapidly, and it was
evident that he had worked out the details in
advance, basing his conclusions upon what he and
I had seen on the night of the storm.</p>

<p>"They will land a party in the launch, and our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
first move will be to capture every man of that
landing party, dead or alive, and without making
any noise. So don't use the firearms. If their
boat's crew doesn't return within a reasonable time,
they'll send again to find out what has become of
it. When they do that, we'll repeat, and by eating
them up a little at a time&mdash;but you get the idea,
I'm sure." And to me: "Dick, will you take the
command? You are better qualified than any of
the rest of us."</p>

<p>"You are doing very well, yourself," I told him.
"Show us the way and we'll stay with you."</p>

<p>"All right," he agreed briefly. "I think we all
understand that this is likely to be our last chance,
so far as the yacht is concerned. There are nine
women up at the other end of the island who will,
in all human probability, starve to death if we
bungle this thing and let the <i>Andromeda</i> get away
from us. Keep that in mind when you hit, and
hit hard!"</p>

<p>Since the choice of position was one of the few
advantages we should have in the coming struggle,
we picked our way silently across the point to the
wood fringe from which Van Dyck and I had witnessed
the earlier landing. Judging from the little
we could see in the starlight, the mutineers were
making hard work of the job of clearing away the
electric launch without the aid of the steam winch.
In spite of Mr. Edison's continued and most
ingenious efforts to find a substitute for the lead
in them, storage batteries are still heavy contrivances;
and at the end of it the weighty little tender
got away from the men at the davit tackles and
dropped into the sea with a resounding slap that
might have been heard half-way around the island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>For a minute or two the small boat lay chafing
against the side of the yacht, and there was no
attempt made to man it; from which we inferred
that the mutineers were waiting to ascertain if the
crash of the sudden launching had given the alarm.
In view of the fact that the invaders had every
reason to believe that we were all either dead or
dying from starvation by this time, it struck me
that they were excessively cautious, and I spoke of
this to Van Dyck.</p>

<p>"That is the 'spiggotty' of it," he commented
in low tones. "Lequat's name is French, but I'd
be willing to bet that he and his backers are of the
mongrel breed&mdash;dock-rats who will fight only when
they're cornered."</p>

<p>"Will they be well armed, do you think?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Heaven knows. Every man that Goff picked
up in New York may have been a walking arsenal,
for all I know to the contrary. As for the yacht
itself, there were only a few sport guns in the
cabins, as you saw for yourself."</p>

<p>Whether they were over-cautious, or only prudently
careful, the intending invaders waited fully
ten minutes, I should say, before making another
move. But at last, silhouetting themselves as
black shadows against the white paint of the
<i>Andromeda's</i> side, a boat's crew came over the rail,
dropping man by man into the launch. We counted
the shadowy figures slipping over the yacht's
side. As in the yawl's crew, there were seven; a
man apiece for us, and one extra, for good measure.</p>

<p>"I'll take that odd man," Billy Grisdale whispered
in my ear. "I can't go back to Edie with less
than two scalps at my belt, you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shut up!" I hissed. "They'll hear you, and
then you won't get even one."</p>

<p>The launch got under way at once and presently
came skimming through the gap in the reef, the
narrowness of which had proved the undoing of
the yawl on the night of the hurricane. The electrically
driven boat made no sound other than the
purring murmur of its motor and the soft, ripping
sheer of the sharp cutwater as it turned a tiny bow
wave. Once within the lagoon, the launch was
steered straight for the beach. This time, as it
appeared, there was to be no shilly-shallying.</p>

<p>A landing was made within a few yards of our
covert. Six of the men got out when the tender's
prow slid up on the sand, and the remaining man
rummaged under the thwarts and heaved a pick
and a shovel ashore. Then a curious thing happened.
Without a word uttered, the six men on
the sands became suddenly involved in a fierce
and mysterious struggle. Twice one of the six
broke away, only to be instantly caught and dragged
back by the others; and it was not until the brief
battle was over, and five of the men were shoving
the sixth ahead of them into the wood, that Van
Dyck found the answer and passed the word to the
rest of us.</p>

<p>"That's Goff, and they're making him show them
the way! Come on!"</p>

<p>We followed, and there was no need for any great
amount of caution on our part. The men ahead of
us were trampling through the jungle undergrowth
with little heed for the noise they made, and we
were close upon them when they halted in the
small open space marked by the lump of coral.
Since it was well-nigh pitch dark in the tree-shadowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
glade, a light of some sort was a necessity,
and one of the men knelt to kindle the wick of
a ship's lantern. The sputtering flare of the match
illuminated a striking tableau for us. Lequat, hatless,
and with a red bandanna bound around his
head in true buccaneer fashion, stood aside, leaning
upon the bared blade of a huge weapon, half sabre
and half machete. Two of the others held Goff
pinioned by his arms, and the odd man had the
pick and shovel.</p>

<p>Van Dyck held us back until the lantern was
fairly alight and the kneeling man was about to
rise. Then, at his whispered "<i>Now!</i>" we rushed
the silent group.</p>

<p>It is a worn saying that a man knows no more of
a battle than that small portion of it which may
fall to his share. My share in the sharp struggle
which followed was simple enough. Out of the confused
tangle of legs and arms and writhing bodies
I dragged my man, one of Goff's pinioners whom
I had picked out in the brief flare of the lantern-lighting
match. That, and a quieting tap from the
butt of the big Navy pistol which had fallen to me
in the distribution of weapons, was all there was to
it. Before I could get in again, the fight was over,
and Van Dyck was stooping to put a match to the
wick of the ship's lantern which had been kicked
aside and had gone out in the scuffling battle.</p>

<p>The scene revealed by the renewed lantern light
was not without its element of grim humor. Our
victory had been sweepingly complete, and the
small open space was strewn with the prone figures
of the vanquished. Van Dyck had been thoughtful
enough to bring a coil of light tent rope with him
from our camp, and Grey and Grisdale were already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
at work like trained thief-takers binding and gagging
the captives. Over in the edge of the glade the
professor was trying mercifully to replace the dislocated
shoulder of a small man who was groaning
and squirming under him, and begging in broken
English to be spared; the patient pleading while the
amateur surgeon was assuring him blandly that the
disabled arm would be pulled out by the roots if he
raised his voice above a whisper.</p>

<p>It was Elijah Goff, fully reinstated now as a
victim of circumstances like ourselves, who went
to the professor's assistance.</p>

<p>"Lemme sit on his head while you yank, Professor,"
he said with dry humor. "I'm owin' that
tarnation little rat suthin' f'r the way he's been
keelhaulin' me." And thereupon we saw that the
professor's capture was the ex-steward, Lequat,
whose formidable weapon the mild-mannered old
scholar had actually broken off short at the hilt
with the same shrewd bludgeon stroke that had
crippled the ex-steward's sword arm.</p>

<p>After our five prisoners were safely trussed up
and silenced with primitive gags made of knotted
rope, we wasted no more time upon them. The
man left with the boat remained to be secured, and
his removal from the scene was a bit of routine.
He had come ashore to stand by the bow of the
beached launch, and apparently he mistook us for
his own people returning. Anyway, he made
scarcely a show of resistance when we surrounded
him, and Billy Grisdale garroted him with the bit
of knotted rope which was presently forced between
his teeth to keep him quiet while we bound and
dragged him back into the wood to the general
rendezvous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>The launch's manning thus disposed of, we held
a sober council of war, with Goff on the witness
stand. The old skipper told his story briefly, and
in the main it accorded fairly well with Van Dyck's
prefigurings. The mutiny and seizure of the yacht
had been real enough, and the conspirators had
chosen the moment when the sham uprising was to
have been staged; namely, the evening when Edie
Van Tromp's cry of "Land-o-o-o!" had announced
the <i>Andromeda's</i> approach to the island. Goff had
been overpowered on the bridge, and the Americans,
Haskell, Quinby and the others, had been imprisoned
in the engine-room and fire hold, where,
so Goff told us, they were still confined. The
skipper could not say how many members of the
crew proper were in the conspiracy, but those who
were not had doubtless been overawed by threats
of violence; given the choice between obedience and
submission, and walking the plank.</p>

<p>"All I know is it ain't a sailormen's crowd,"
said the grizzled old Gloucesterman in summing up.
"It's mostly cooks and cabin stewards, and that
kind of riff-raff, with that fat Frenchman, Bassinette,
at the head of 'em. Near as I could figger,
they're revolutionaries o' some sort. They got an
idee there was big money some'ere's aboard, and
I cal'late they've dum near tore the insides out o'
the yacht lookin' for it."</p>

<p>"Bassinette, the <i>chef?</i>" Van Dyck queried.
"Then this fellow Lequat wasn't the ringleader?"</p>

<p>"No more 'n I be," said Goff. "He's nothin'
but an understrapper, carryin' out orders. But
he's a navigator&mdash;of a sort."</p>

<p>"Where has the yacht been all this time?" It
was Grey who wanted to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Been mostly standin' off and on over to the
Central American coast, unloadin' a cargo of guns
and ammynition that was picked up off the Isle
o' Pines," was the calm reply. "When they got
through with that, Bassinette told me he was comin'
back here to take you folks off. I mistrusted he
was lyin' like a whitehead about what he was
comin' for, but it looked 's if any chance was better
'n none, so I give him his bearin's, which I suspicion
Lequat wa'n't sailorman enough to figger out f'r
himself. There was bad weather brewin' when we
got here, and they had to cut and run f'r it afore a
gale o' wind."</p>

<p>"Did they try to land at all?" Billy Grisdale
asked.</p>

<p>"Couldn't prove nothin' by me," said Goff, and
I got the idea he was trying to fight off from the
question. "They had me locked up in one o' the
cabins."</p>

<p>At this, Grey broke in again.</p>

<p>"You say you mistrusted that these fellows were
not coming back to take us off, Captain Goff:
what were they coming for, then? And what were
they planning to do back here in the wood with a
pick and shovel just now when we closed in on
them?"</p>

<p>I saw Van Dyck's hand shoot out to grip the
sailing-master's arm. If it were a warning, the old
skipper was quick to act upon it.</p>

<p>"There's an old yarn about a buried gold-mine
some'res in these waters," he drawled. "I guess
putty near everybody's heard it, fust 'r last.
Shouldn't wonder if Bassinette and his crowd think
they've got a pointer on it. Maybe they thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
that was what we was headin' here for. Wouldn't
supprise me a mite."</p>

<p>The explanation was certainly an ingenious one,
and it fully proved the justice of Van Dyck's trust
in the old fisherman skipper. But the questioner
was still unsatisfied. In his proper environment,
as I have said, Mr. John Grey figured as an able
young lawyer, and when he could forget Annette
and his new-found happiness long enough, the
lawyer gifts came easily to the front.</p>

<p>"What made them bring you ashore, Captain
Goff?" he asked shrewdly.</p>

<p>But Goff proved to be far too old a bird to be
caught napping.</p>

<p>"Maybe they was cal'latin' to have me do the
diggin'," he returned with a sly chuckle. "Wouldn't
put it a mite beyond 'em."</p>

<p>It was Van Dyck who brought the talk back to
things present and pressing.</p>

<p>"We know definitely now what we are up against,"
he said. "How many of the men are in this with
Bassinette, Captain 'Lige?"</p>

<p>"They kep' me too close to tell. Maybe half of
'em, 'r maybe more. And another thing&mdash;they've
got guns and pistols, plenty of 'em."</p>

<p>Some earnest of this we had had in the taking of
the prisoners in the glade. They were all armed,
but the weapons were for the most part out of date;
pistols and knives, one repeating rifle of an old
model, a pair of brass knuckles, a wicked looking
"life-preserver"&mdash;a short leather club, lead-loaded
in the striking end. But we found only a scattering
score or so of cartridges for the firearms.</p>

<p>These weapons we now shared impartially among
ourselves, and when the professor volunteered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
go back in the wood and stand guard over the
prisoners, Van Dyck suggested that it was time we
were making a reconnaissance in force in the enemy's
direction, the war council having been held at a
point about half-way between the glade and the
beach. Nobody could say certainly what move the
mutineers on the yacht would make next, and in spite
of Goff's assurances to the contrary, Van Dyck was
afraid they might take the alarm and run away,
abandoning the launch's crew to whatever fate had
befallen it.</p>

<p>"Not much danger o' that," Goff insisted; and
after Grisdale, Grey and Dupuyster had been
posted in the forest fringe with instructions to keep
a sharp lookout for renewed activities upon the
<i>Andromeda</i>, Van Dyck drew Goff and me aside and
went straight to the heart of things.</p>

<p>"Mr. Preble and I were here on the beach that
night when the yacht came up and then had to
make a run for it, Captain 'Lige," he began.
"Didn't you know they sent a boat's crew ashore
that night?"</p>

<p>Goff nodded. "Didn't know how much 'r how
little you wanted t'other folks to know. Had me
locked up in a cabin on the starb'd side and I saw
the yawl get off&mdash;and saw that it didn't get back.
Maybe you can tell me what happened to that
boat-load o' scamps?"</p>

<p>Van Dyck told our part in the happenings briefly,
and the old Banksman chuckled delightedly.</p>

<p>"Good stroke o' business&mdash;catchin' 'em that way
when they was all fagged out with swimmin',"&mdash;adding
vindictively: "only you ought to 've knocked
every single one on 'em in the head, when you had
'em. As it was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Van Dyck; "as it was?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As it was, we clawed back here just afore day
the next mornin', and with the seas putty near
rollin' the yacht's rail under, Bassinette made out
to get ashore with the gasoline launch when it was
just about as much as any man's life was worth to
try it. He fetched back five o' the seven men that
went ashore in the yawl. You said two of 'em was
drowned, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"They were," said I.</p>

<p>"This man Bassinette," Van Dyck broke in.
"He is the cook you picked up in New York. Did
you know anything about him when you shipped
him?"</p>

<p>Goff shook his head. "Somethin' kind o' queer
about that big lummux," he averred. "If I didn't
know better, I'd 'most be willin' to go into court and
swear he isn't the man I shipped in New York.
Looks as much like him as two peas, but that's all.
If we'd been anywheres to get rid o' him and pick
up his double&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait," I interposed. "We laid up for a day at
Gracias á Dios with a disabled propeller shaft.
Didn't some of the men have shore leave that
day?"</p>

<p>"By gravy, I b'lieve you've hit it, Mr. Preble!"
Goff exclaimed. "It was after we left Gracias that
I took to noticin' that Bassinette seemed sort o'
different, somehow; didn't grin same as he used to
when I'd stick my head into his galley. And he
was consider'ble thick with a bunch o' them outlandishmen
we picked up in New York ha'bor.
Look 's if we'd all ought to be bored f'r the hollow-horn,
Mr. Van Dyck!"</p>

<p>It was beginning to look that way to me, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
but Van Dyck didn't push the inquiry any further.</p>

<p>"We can let that part of it rest for the present,"
he said, and at his suggestion we joined the other
three in the ambush at the beach edge.</p>

<p>Up to this time there had been no further sign
of life on board the yacht. Though there were no
premonitory symptoms of a storm brewing, the
night was oppressively warm and there was hardly
a breath of air stirring. Nevertheless, there is
always some little movement in the sea, and during
the interval which had elapsed since the launch
party had left her, the <i>Andromeda</i> had drifted a
bit nearer in and was now fairly opposite the narrow
reef inlet, and not more than a short cable's length
outside of it.</p>

<p>"If we could only contrive some means of making
them come to anchor," Van Dyck muttered. "A
bit of breeze would turn the trick, but there is no
promise of that."</p>

<p>"He'd be too foxy to anchor, even if 'twas blowin'
half a gale," was Goff's reply to this. "What I say
is to take the launch and board him. There's six
of us, and we've got the tools, such as they are.
I cal'late if we could fight our way to the engine-room
hatch and let Haskell and his gang out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am afraid to risk the boarding," Van Dyck
admitted. "Not for ourselves, but for the women
who will be left if we shouldn't succeed. There are
good glasses on board, and those fellows probably
know how to use them. If it were only a little
darker, so that we might stand some chance of
getting out to them before they could recognize us&mdash;but
they'd be sure to, and put steam to the
yacht."</p>

<p>I guess the suspense was getting on our nerves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
I am sure it was on mine. The very silence was
oppressive, and it seemed as if the lapping of the
little waves on the sands and the rise and fall of
the gentle swell on the reef were hushed. Then,
too, the white yacht in the near offing grew more
and more like a ghost ship as we strained our eyes
watching her for some sign of life. It was
Dupuyster who broke the spell.</p>

<p>"I say, Bonteck, old dear, don't you know, I'm
the only original human fish, when it comes to
swimmin'," he whispered. "Toss me the sharpest
knife in the lot, and I'll toddle out there and
anchor the <i>Andromeda</i> for you&mdash;dashed if I don't."</p>

<p>Of course, there was a low-toned chorus of protest.
Sharks occasionally came into the lagoon,
as we all knew, and since ships usually have a
following of them in tropical waters, there would
certainly be one or more of the man-eaters in the
deeper water beyond the reef. Also, admitting
that a swimmer could reach the <i>Andromeda</i> without
having a leg or an arm bitten off on the way, there
were mechanical difficulties to be overcome. The
anchors were catted at the bows of the yacht, with
the slack of the cables taken in, and the anchor
flukes themselves triced up in heavy hempen slings
in man-o'-war style. It would be a man's job to
cut the slings with anything short of a sharp axe.</p>

<p>Our arguments nugatory were hurried but
thorough. If Dupuyster should live to reach the
yacht and climb aboard, he would certainly be
discovered from the bridge before he could cut the
lashings to free an anchor. And, admitting that
the thing could be done, what would be gained?
What was to prevent the mutineers from throwing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the steam winch into gear and heaving the anchor
up again?</p>

<p>While we were expostulating, Jerry&mdash;not the
carefully Anglicized clubman we had known, but
a most surprisingly red-blooded reincarnation of
him&mdash;was calmly preparing to get himself shark-bitten.</p>

<p>"I say, by Jove, you chappies had better hedge
on some of those bets you're making," he drawled.
"If Uncle Jimmie were here, he'd take you, don't
you know. Find me that knife, and a couple of
the biggest pistol cartridges. That's all I want."</p>

<p>Provided with his simple armament, Jerry,
stripped to the buff, and with the knife and the
cartridges secured in an impromptu belt made of
his discarded undershirt, wormed his way down to
the beach and took the water under the bilge of
the stranded launch as silently as a fish. When he
came up from the long dive we could trace him by
the faint phosphorescence showing now and then in
the ripples of his wake.</p>

<p>It was a horrible strain, watching him as he
worked his way across the lagoon to the inlet
through the reef. Every instant we were expecting
to see the disturbance which would mark the
lunge and back-roll of an attacking man-eater, and
I could not help wondering which of the two
women, Conetta or Beatrice Van Tromp, would
reproach us the more bitterly for letting him go
to his death.</p>

<p>We lost trace of him after his faintly luminous
trail disappeared at the gap in the reef. Just then
the windless calm was broken by a mere breath of air
stirring out of the southeast, and the <i>Andromeda</i>,
still a dead hulk swinging gently to the slow heave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
and dip of the scarcely perceptible swell, was now
drifting landward by more than the measured inchings;
she had decreased her earliest distance by
considerably more than half. It could be only
a matter of minutes before whoever was in command
would have to give her sternway with the
engines to keep her from going on the reef, in which
case Dupuyster would have taken his life in his
hand for nothing. A half-dozen backward turns of
the big twin screws would take the yacht out of
his reach, and would probably take her out of
soundings so that a dropped anchor would find no
bottom.</p>

<p>Van Dyck whispered all this to me while we
were holding our breath and making our eyes
water in the effort to get another glimpse of the
swimmer's trail.</p>

<p>"He'll never make it&mdash;never in this world!" Van
Dyck concluded in the stifled whisper. "We were
criminal fools for letting him try it. It's sheer
suicide, and we all knew it!"</p>

<p>"I have forgiven him," I said grimly.</p>

<p>"Forgiven him? For what?"</p>

<p>"For playing fast and loose with Conetta. He
has asked her, you know, and she has said 'Yes.'
And in spite of that, he has been making open love
to Beatrice Van Tromp ever since we were put
ashore here."</p>

<p>"Don't make a damned jealous idiot of yourself!"
was the hot retort. "If you weren't bat-blind
in both eyes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The interruption was the thunderous racket we
had by this time given up all hope of hearing. With
a mighty splash and a deafening clamor from the
paying-out cable, the <i>Andromeda's</i> starboard anchor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
let go, and from the shortness of the uproar we
knew that it had taken ground upon the outer
ledges of the reef. Following the rattling clamor,
we heard the pad-pad of running men, and were
able to guess that the slack discipline of the mutineers
had been responsible for a deserted forward
deck. There was a barked-out order in a foreign
tongue from the bridge, a hissing of steam, and
the power capstan was promptly set in motion to
break the anchor out of its hold.</p>

<p>At the second or third turn of the capstan something
happened; a snapping explosion up forward,
and a prolonged hammering and grinding, as if
the steam hoisting machinery were patiently and
painstakingly wrecking itself. In the midst of this
new turmoil we saw a slender white figure shoot
over the yacht's bow in a headlong dive, and heard
the crackling spatter of a pistol fusillade opened
upon the diver from the bridge.</p>

<p>"We'll hang the last living man of them if they
got him!" Van Dyck declared vindictively, when
the velvety silence of the tropical night had settled
down again, and we had looked earnestly but in
vain for some sign of the diver from the yacht's
bows. Then he turned to Grey: "Jack, you'd
better drop out and run back to camp. It is
hardly possible that the women are sleeping through
all this war noise. You'll know what to say. Tell
them to keep together and to make no noise.
They're out of the danger zone, and we'll make it
our business to try to prevent the scrapping from
drifting down to that end of the island. Don't
say anything about Jerry. We won't give him up
until we have to. That's all; but hurry back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
We'll probably be needing you by the time you've
made the round trip."</p>

<p>Grey slipped off silently, doubling the sandspit
point of the island in order to have the unmenaced
north beach for his speedway. After he was gone
there was a terrible wait for the four of us left
crouching in the shadow of the palms. For what
seemed like an age there was no sign of our forlorn-hope
swimmer. As nearly as we could judge from
the noises on board the yacht, the mutineers were
trying to repair the disabled capstan. Apparently
it didn't suit them to be tied by the leg and unable
to run away.</p>

<p>"Let me have that old rifle, Billy," said Van
Dyck; this after the capstan noises had been located.
Lying flat, Bonteck aimed as well as he
could in the uncertain light, and we distinctly
heard the clang of the bullet as it penetrated the
metal bulwarks of the yacht's stem. The single
shot did the business, and we heard no more hammerings
at the crippled machinery.</p>

<p>Beyond this, we waited again while the minutes
dragged on, leaden-winged, slowly but surely extinguishing
the hope that Dupuyster had escaped.
But, after hope was quite dead in the four hearts
of us, and a hot thirst for vengeance was beginning
to take its place, we saw Jerry in our own edge
of the lagoon, swimming slowly and rolling from
side to side with his stroke, like a man utterly spent.</p>

<p>I think all four of us dashed wildly into the shallows
to drag him out and rush him to cover in the
jungle edge. He was gasping for breath, and even
in the poor light we could see a long red splash on
one thigh; a cut from which the blood was still
oozing. Van Dyck stripped his own shirt to bandage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the wound, and the reincarnated one protested
manfully.</p>

<p>"Bally lot of trouble you're takin' over a scratch,"
he gurgled. "Bleedin' will stop of its own accord
when it gets ready. But if any gentleman should&mdash;er&mdash;happen
to have a drop of cognac about
him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Grisdale hadn't, and I hadn't, and I was pretty
sure Van Dyck hadn't. But at a three-handed
chorus of "Sorry, old man," Elijah Goff, the one
dyed-in-the-wool teetotaller of the <i>Andromeda's</i>
company, produced a pocket flask, and Dupuyster
took a single swallow from it; swallowed, choked a
bit over whatever fiery liquor it was, and then told
us his story while we were giving him a rough-handed
rub-down and helping him into his clothes.</p>

<p>"No, the swim wasn't anything, but I had a
perishin' lot of trouble climbin' aboard the old
tub. After that, it was easy; all I had to do was
to cut a lot of the rope things you told me about
and stand clear, what?"</p>

<p>"But the capstan?" Billy Grisdale wanted to
know. "How the dickens did you contrive to put
that out of commission?"</p>

<p>"Dynamited it, old dear; stuck the two bally
pistol cartridges into the cogwheels, don't you
know, and hoped they'd do their bit when the
wheels began to turn. If you'll believe me, the
shop was fairly dizzy with bits of iron and things
when they put the steam on. I didn't wait to see
the third act. His Jaglets was waitin' for me, and
I took a header to get a fair start of him, don't
you see."</p>

<p>"A shark!" gasped Billy.</p>

<p>"You've named him. The perishin' beggar had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
followed me all the way out to the yacht and
couldn't quite make up his mind to try it on. But
comin' back he got his nerve screwed up, by Jove.
It was under the edge of the reef, and when he
turned for the snap I stuck the bloomin' knife into
him and left it there."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but he bit you in the leg!" said Billy,
and I knew he was swelling up like the frog in
the fable with a huge access of hero-worship.</p>

<p>"Chuck it, Billy," said the shark fighter good-naturedly,
and for once in a way the British accent
was lacking. "Let's say that I scratched the leg
climbin' over the reef. It'll sound better."</p>

<p>Just then Grey came back, having cut across the
island from the north beach by way of the glade
where the prisoners had been left. His report was
reassuring. The women, and two of the men, the
major and Holly Barclay, had been awakened by
the firing, but there was no panic&mdash;proof positive
that we had finally vanquished the greater part of
the civilized conventions. Ingerson was still asleep,
and Grey suspected that he had found the last of
the brandy bottles, the one which Van Dyck had
been jealously hoarding against an emergency.
Grey admitted that he had lied freely to the non-combatants,
particularly in assuring his wife and
Conetta, Madeleine and Beatrice Van Tromp and
Edie, that none of us was taking any chance of
getting hurt. He had repeated Van Dyck's instructions,
and they had promised not to scatter,
and to stay under cover&mdash;such cover as the wood
afforded. Finishing up, Grey spoke of the professor
and his guard-mounting over the six pirates.</p>

<p>"He has the lantern between his knees, and I
found him dissecting some leaves he had picked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
up, and poring over that little pocket Botany of
his," he chuckled. "He didn't see me at all until
I came up and said 'Scat!' to him."</p>

<p>This part of the report was rather disconcerting.
With the professor engrossed in his favorite study,
anything might happen in the way of a jail delivery,
and I said as much.</p>

<p>"Go and see about it, Dick," was Van Dyck's
order, and I was about to obey when Billy Grisdale
gripped my arm and pointed toward the yacht.
On the deck of the <i>Andromeda</i>, where everything
had been quiet since the firing of the shot which
had driven the capstan repairers from their job, a
dimly defined group of toilers were hoisting some
heavy object to the roof of the raised deck house.
I couldn't make out what they were doing, but
Bonteck's eyes were better than mine.</p>

<p>"Duck and scatter!" he commanded sharply.
"It's the little signal gun, and they're training it on
us!"</p>

<p>We had dodged and run nimbly to right and left
before the little brass signal piece belched fire and
sent a volley of nondescript missiles hurtling into
the scrub palmettos under which we had been
crouching. What the desperate chief cook of the
<i>Andromeda</i> hoped to accomplish by this haphazard
bombardment of the jungle which, so far as he
knew, sheltered a half-dozen of his own men as
well as whatever enemy he thought he was firing
at, was a mystery unexplained until after our
scattered force was reassembled safely out of range.</p>

<p>But we were made to understand quickly enough.
Under cover of the cannon fire, the electric launch
slid out from its landing place upon the placid
waters of the lagoon, cut a swift half-circle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
headed for the open sea and the yacht. While we
were watching and waiting, some one of the mutineers
had emulated Dupuyster's daring example,
and had swum ashore to steal the launch, thus
putting an end to any notion we may have had of
fighting the little war to a conclusion on the <i>Andromeda's</i>
deck.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>




<h2>XVI<br />
<br />
<small>A MARATHON AND AN ULTIMATUM</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Calling</span> this bold cutting-out of the electric
launch the close of the first bout, we were obliged
to admit that the enemy had taken a hard fall out
of us at the finish. As matters now stood, the
advantage was with the mutineers. To be sure,
we had six of their men, including their first mate
and navigator, safely laid by the heels; and Jerry
Dupuyster's plucky adventure had tied up the
yacht, temporarily, at least. But without a boat
we could not press the fighting, and the six hostages
were more likely to prove a burden than a forfeit
with which to bargain. Bassinette, or whoever it
was who was commanding the mutineers, would
know that he was dealing with men who would
neither starve nor slay their prisoners; though he
should have known, and doubtless did know, that
we ourselves were by this time in dire straits for
food. And as to the tethering anchor chain, they
would surely be a witless lot aboard of the <i>Andromeda</i>
if they should not remember that they could
compel Haskell and his mechanician assistants to
cut the cable.</p>

<p>It soon developed, however, that the amateur
pirates were not thinking of running away. Shortly
after the electric launch had whisked to safety under
the stern of the yacht, it appeared again with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
new crew to man it. At first we thought the militant
chief cook was going to attempt a sortie and a
rescue of the prisoners, but he had a better scheme
than that, as we were presently to learn. Keeping
outside of the enclosing reef, he sent the launch
slowly westward, holding it far enough out to
be beyond pistol range, but paralleling the reef as
if seeking for another inlet. Elijah Goff hazarded a
guess at his intention.</p>

<p>"You folks 've got a camp o' some sort, hain't
ye?" he asked; and when Van Dyck gave the
expected affirmative: "I guess maybe he's spyin'
'round to find that camp. He cal'lates that'll be
your weak spot, if you've got one."</p>

<p>That was enough to set us swiftly in motion, of
course, and by hastening we kept abreast of the
launch all the way along the south side of the
island, though with no little difficulty, since, under
the fair certainty that the boat's crew had firearms,
we dared not show ourselves on the beach. At the
western end of the island Grey cut across to carry
word to the women, while the rest of us fought with
the jungle and so kept the launch in sight all the
way around the point.</p>

<p>Doubling the western reef ledge, the reconnoitering
boat party proceeded to pass the northern
shore of the island in review; and again we kept
the pace, watching each inlet through the reef
narrowly as the launch approached it, and hoping,
rather than fearing, that the mutineers would turn
in and attempt a landing and so bring matters to
a crisis. It was grueling work keeping abreast of
the motor-driven tender, and by the time we had
made the complete circuit of the island, we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
wringing wet with perspiration, and spent with
running.</p>

<p>It was not until after a second circuit of the island
was begun, with the launch still dribbling along
outside of the reef, that we came to the full knowledge
of what the mutineer chief was doing. He
assumed that we would be following him and
keeping him in sight, and he meant to run us to
death; in other words, to keep us running until
we could run no more. He doubtless knew, or
guessed, that our camp was at the opposite end of
the island from the treasure plantation, and that
we couldn't guard both at the same time.</p>

<p>The second lap of the Marathon was a sheer
fight for life, or, rather, for the breath to sustain
life. If we could have kept to the beach without
drawing the fire of the launch it would not have
been so bad, but a single attempt to do this brought
a flash and crack from the sea, and we had to dive
to cover again. By the time we reached the camp
end of the island this second time, Grey was reeling
and tripping like a drunken man, and Van Dyck
ordered him out of the running ranks.</p>

<p>"Stay by the women!" was the gasped-out
command, and thereupon we lost Grey.</p>

<p>The completion of the second lap practically
finished the five of us who were still in the race.
When we came in sight of the <i>Andromeda</i> we were
staggering and stumbling and caroming helplessly
against the trees and other obstacles. Unless we
should be given a breathing space we all knew that
the game was up, so far as we were concerned;
but happily the breath-catching interval was given
us. Reaching the inlet opposite the yacht, the
mutineers steered the motor-driven tender boldly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
through it and headed for the island beach. The
chief was evidently taking it for granted that
he had worn us out and left us behind, and was
making a quick dash to gain possession of the
island.</p>

<p>Van Dyck kept his head, in spite of the maddening
fatigue that was fairly killing every man of us.</p>

<p>"Down!" he panted hoarsely. "Get ready and
hold your fire until you can see their faces&mdash;then
let 'em have it!"</p>

<p>At the most, we wouldn't have had to wait more
than a minute or so; but Billy Grisdale was too
young and too excited to wait. While the launch
was still so far out as to make a shot a mere guess
hazard in the starlight, Billy pulled the trigger of
the pistol which had fallen to him in the distribution
of the captured weapons, and the mischief was
done. Of course, we all banged away at the crack
of Billy's pistol, but there was every reason to
believe that the volley went wide of the mark. In
a twinkling the tender's motor was reversed, and
there was a wild scramble aboard of her to get the
emergency oars out to help her around. In the
thick of it Van Dyck took a long-distance chance
with the old-model rifle. There was a shrill scream
and a flash of blue-and-green electric fire from the
boat's motor to follow the shot, and the power went
off. Goff's chuckle was like the creaking of a rusty
door-hinge.</p>

<p>"I cal'late they won't run the legs off'n us
any more with <i>that</i> push boat," he said; and since
the launch's crew paddled hurriedly out to the
<i>Andromeda</i> with the motor still dead, the prophecy
seemed to be in the way of fulfilling itself.</p>

<p>Shortly after the last man had disappeared over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the yacht's rail, the empty launch, apparently
towed from the deck above, also disappeared around
the stern of the <i>Andromeda</i>, by which we inferred
that the mutineers had some notion of trying to repair
it, or at least of determining to what extent its
motor was crippled. Pending another move, we
waited again, and were glad enough of a chance to
lie quiet and have a breathing spell.</p>

<p>While we were resting, Grey came up, pluckily
refusing to be left out of the forefront of things.
As before, he had skirted the northern beach and
had crossed through the treasure glade to come up
behind us as we lay watching the yacht. Sanford,
he reported, was still holding the lantern upon the
pages of his Botany book, and was only mildly
curious to know what all the running and racing
and shooting portended.</p>

<p>At "Camp Hurricane," as Edie Van Tromp had
named our storm-driven refuge, there was plenty
of excitement, and quite naturally a good bit of
alarm. Of the three men who might be said to be
posing as "home guards," only one, Major Terwilliger,
Grey told us, had offered to join the fighting
force. Barclay was again playing sick, and Ingerson
was sleeping, log-like, through it all.</p>

<p>"I took it upon myself to turn the major down,"
said Grey. "He is too old to keep the pace we've
been setting, so I told him to stay by the women,
and left my pistol with him to chirk him up a bit.
But I doubt if he'd put up much of a fight, for all
his military title."</p>

<p>"Ow, I say, old dear; you're off, there," Jerry
put in quickly. "Uncle Jimmie will fight like a
dashed old billy goat if he's pushed to it, don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
you know!" And we were obliged to take Jerry's
word for it.</p>

<p>After the disappearance of the electric launch
around the stern of the <i>Andromeda</i> there were no
sounds for a time; nothing that would enable us
to guess what the mutineers' next move would be.
But later there came a creaking of tackles, and the
clanking of a steam winch&mdash;one of the smaller
winches operating the boat falls.</p>

<p>"Taking the tender aboard for repairs," I suggested;
but Van Dyck said they were more likely
lowering the long-boat, which was also motor-driven
with a small gasoline engine for its propelling
power.</p>

<p>"How about it, Captain 'Lige?" he queried;
and the sailing-master confirmed the guess, saying:</p>

<p>"That's about the way of it. That con-dummed
Frenchman is layin' off to give us another chance
to play ring-around-the-rosy with him."</p>

<p>Billy Grisdale had kept quiet for five full minutes,
which was little less than miraculous.</p>

<p>"Say," he broke in, "I've been hearing something
like a file or a saw going out there on the
yacht ever since the scrimmage was called off.
Listen!"</p>

<p>We did listen, and the sound was unmistakable.
Van Dyck clicked the lever of the repeating rifle
and sent a shot whistling over the <i>Andromeda's</i>
bow. There was a clatter as of hastily dropped
tools and the filing noise ceased.</p>

<p>"It'll begin again, just as soon as he's toled us
away from here," Goff predicted. "He's got to
gnaw himself loose from that anchor, and he
knows it."</p>

<p>Van Dyck took the hint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are going to keep as much as we've got,"
he declared. And then to Grey: "How well do
you shoot, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't hit the side of a barn, not even if it
were painted white," confessed the rising young
lawyer.</p>

<p>It was at this conjuncture that Jerry Dupuyster
surprised us again.</p>

<p>"Me for the bally old pot-shotting. I'm fairly
good at the birds, don't you know. Took the blue
ribbon over the field at Lord Erpin'am's last fall&mdash;what?
Give me the gun, and say when and where."</p>

<p>Bonteck passed the rifle over to the reincarnated
club idler.</p>

<p>"You heard what Goff said. That infernal
French sea cook will begin to run us again as soon
as he gets the long-boat over the side. When that
happens, you stay here and keep your ear out for
that anchor-chain filing. If it begins again, aim
a little high and invite them to quit."</p>

<p>"I'm on," said Dupuyster. "But I'm dashed if
I know why you want me to hold high on the
perishers."</p>

<p>"For the simple reason that they may be forcing
Haskell or Quinby to do the work, and we don't
want to kill any of our friends," was Bonteck's
explanation.</p>

<p>While he was speaking we heard the first broken
sputterings of the long-boat's gasoline engine, and
a little later the boat itself slid out like a white
shadow past the <i>Andromeda's</i> stem, and a third
circumnavigation of the island was begun. Van
Dyck stood up, tightened his belt and groaned.
"We're in for another ride on the merry-go-round!"
he lamented. "Fall in, you fellows."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>We fell in, and the word was well-chosen. Lying
by for the half-hour or so after doing the double
Marathon had stiffened every weary leg muscle.
Cursing the mutineers for the lack, or seeming
lack, of originality which was leading them to
repeat an expedient that had failed, we ran on,
taking to the beach now, and risking a volley from
the long-boat for the sake of having a better running
track.</p>

<p>So running, and keeping cannily abreast of the
white shadow in the offing, we had covered possibly
half of the distance to the western end of the
island when the crack of a rifle from the rear,
followed instantly by a scattering fusillade, halted
us abruptly.</p>

<p>The rifle was replying spitefully to the fusillade
as Van Dyck, who had been leading the race,
wheeled, spread his arms and herded us into the
back track.</p>

<p>"They've played it on us!" he yelled. "There's
only one man in that long-boat, and the others
are trying to put something over on Jerry!"</p>

<p>They were; and the trick had almost succeeded
when we reached the strip of beach that Dupuyster
was defending. The crippled electric launch,
propelled by oars, and carrying possibly a dozen
men, was half-way across the lagoon, heading
straight for the beach, and coming on regardless of
Jerry's rifle. Above the din of battle we could
hear the shrill, squeaky voice of the fat cook
encouraging his men. "Pull on ze oar, <i>mes braves!
Sacré tonnerre!</i> eet is but wan man dat shoot ze
gon!"</p>

<p>But when we came up there were five more to
shoot, and instant and utter demoralization fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
upon the attacking force. Shrieks of surrender in
half a dozen different languages rent the still night
air, and in a mad endeavor to turn the boat an
oar was lost overboard.</p>

<p>If our situation had not been so critically desperate,
there was enough of the comic-opera element
in the frantic attempt to retreat to have
brought down the house. As it was, Van Dyck
stopped the firing and shouted to the mutineers
to come ashore and surrender. Some of the men
were evidently sick of their bargain and wanted to
quit, but the squeaky cries of the chief robber
dominated the tumult, and under a renewal of our
bombardment the launch was got around and
headed back to the yacht with much splashing
and hard swearing. Also, when the goal of safety
was reached, we could make out dimly that the
accommodation ladder was let down, and that two
or three members of the boat's crew had to be
helped aboard.</p>

<p>A few minutes after this, we had audible proof of
the correctness of Van Dyck's guess about the
long-boat and the ingenious ruse to draw us off.
The gasoline craft was coming back, as we could
determine by the increasing loudness of its exhaust.
Following its return to the yacht we were given
another little breathing spell, and John Grey's
quality of professional curiosity had an opportunity
to show itself again.</p>

<p>"I can't understand for the life of me why these
fellows should come back here and fight us so
desperately for a chance to get ashore," he protested.
"You can't make me believe that they're
doing it on the strength of a silly yarn that is three
hundred years old."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you think about it, Captain 'Lige?"
said Bonteck, ungenerously handing the tangle over
to Goff.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't put it a mite apast 'em," was the
skipper's guarded reply. "There was a good deal
o' talk among the men about buried gold-mines and
such on the way down from New Orleans. I ain't
no gre't hand at the foreign lingoes, myself, but I
picked up a word or two here and there."</p>

<p>"I don't more than half believe it, just the same,"
Grey persisted. "I tell you, these fellows are not
fighting for the bare chance of proving or disproving
that old story about the <i>Santa Lucia's</i>
buried treasure. They've got inside information of
some sort, and I'll bet on it."</p>

<p>"Maybe they have," said Goff, in a tone which
said plainly that the matter was one not worth
worrying about.</p>

<p>Grey got upon his feet.</p>

<p>"We have six of these pirates back here in the
woods: why can't we make them talk and tell us
what they are trying to do?"</p>

<p>At this, Van Dyck took a hand.</p>

<p>"They would lie about it, as a matter of course,"
he interjected. "Besides, their particular object
doesn't make any vital difference to us. They are
here, and our present business is to see to it that
they don't get away again&mdash;with the yacht."</p>

<p>Grey sat down again, grumbling.</p>

<p>"I don't see that we are getting ahead very fast,"
he complained. "What in Sam Hill do you suppose
they're waiting for now?"</p>

<p>The answer to Grey's impatient query was at
that moment coming around the <i>Andromeda's</i>
stern. It was the disabled electric launch again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
this time with only one man in it, and he was
sculling it with an oar over the stern, slowly working
his way toward the gap in the reef. When it came
a bit nearer we could see that the loom of a broken
oar had been rigged as a mast in the bow, with a
white flag of some sort dangling from it.</p>

<p>"A parley," I said; and Goff grunted acquiescence.
But Jerry Dupuyster worked the lever of
his rifle to reload.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot, Jerry," Bonteck cautioned in low
tones; whereat the emancipated idler chuckled.</p>

<p>"Couldn't if I wanted to, by Jove; the bally cartridges
are all gone, what?"</p>

<p>The huge lump of a man in the stern of the launch
stopped sculling when he was within easy calling
distance of the shore, and the boat lost way.</p>

<p>"Ahoy ze island!" he hailed, in a voice ridiculously
out of proportion to his barrel-girthed
bigness.</p>

<p>"Get to work with that oar and come ashore!"
was Van Dyck's brusque command, to which he
added: "We've got you covered."</p>

<p>"<i>Non, non!</i> it ees ze flag of ze truce!" shrilled
the voice. And then the fat cook handed out an
argument that was much more binding: "Ve haf
ze enchineers in ze hold shut up, and eef you shoot
wiz ze gon, zey will be keel!"</p>

<p>"Talk it out, then," said Van Dyck. "What do
you want?"</p>

<p>"Ve make ze proposal&mdash;w'at you call ze proposition.
It ees zat you vill all go to ze ozzer end of
zis island, <i>immédiatement</i>. W'en you do zat, ve
leave you ze long-boat to go 'way, w'erever you
like to go. W'at you do wiz Lequat and hees
mens?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lequat and his men are where you won't find
them in a hurry," was Bonteck's answer. "As to
your demand that we go away and let you steal
the yacht again, there's nothing doing."</p>

<p>"<i>Sacré bleu!</i> It ees ze&mdash;w'at you call heem?&mdash;ze
ooltimatum. W'en ees come daylight, ve put
ze leetle cannon on ze long boat and keel all&mdash;<i>oui!</i>"</p>

<p>At this savage pronouncement we held a whispered
consultation, the fat pirate sitting back in the
stern sheets of the launch and calmly lighting a
cigarette. Could we, dare we, take the risk of a
daylight bombardment, even though the single piece
of artillery were only the yacht's little brass muzzle-loading
signal piece, with such iron scraps as the
mutineers might be able to find or manufacture for
the missiles? It was a dubious question. Though
our island was nearly if not quite a mile in length,
its greatest width did not exceed four or five hundred
yards, and the little gun would easily put it
under a cross-fire from either side.</p>

<p>"Have they powder?" I asked of Goff.</p>

<p>"Tain't likely they haven't&mdash;with them a-handlin'
all that war stuff from the Isle o' Pines."</p>

<p>"But nothing that would answer for grape-shot?"</p>

<p>"Pots and kittles in the galley, and a hammer to
smash 'em with," said the old Gloucesterman.
"That's good enough, I cal'late."</p>

<p>"Speak up, all of you," said Van Dyck. "Shall
I try to drive a bargain with him for the long-boat?
If he gives us enough gasoline, we might be able
to make Willemstadt, on the island of Curaçao&mdash;with
fair weather and a smooth sea. That is the
nearest inhabited land, but it is something over a
hundred-and-fifty-mile run."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Grey was the first to "speak up."</p>

<p>"I have more at stake than any of you," he said,
thereby showing that the married lover may be
stone blind to all things extraneous to his own
particular and private little Eden. "Just the same,
I say, fight it out."</p>

<p>"Here, too," echoed Billy Grisdale; and Jerry
Dupuyster also came up promptly in his carefully
acquired accent: "Ow, I say! we cawn't knuckle
down to a lot of bally cooks and sailormen, what?"</p>

<p>"And you, Preble?" queried Van Dyck, turning
to me.</p>

<p>I refused to vote, merely saying: "You know
I'm with you, either way."</p>

<p>It was Goff's turn, but instead of taking it, he
leaned over to whisper hoarsely: "Make him talk
some, Mr. Van Dyck; tell him to work his proposition
off ag'in, and say it slow. That boat's
a-driftin' in, and if it comes a leetle mite
nearer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Van Dyck stood up and called to the maker
of ultimatums.</p>

<p>"State your proposal again, and let us have it
in detail. Will you leave a supply of gasoline in
the long-boat? Will you give us provisions, and
a compass and sextant?"</p>

<p>The fat <i>chef</i> flung his cigarette away and we
heard the little hiss of the spark as the water
quenched it.</p>

<p>"Ze proposal ees zis: zat you take your fran's
and go back to ze ladees. Again I h-ask you w'at
you done wiz Monsieur Lequat and hees men?"</p>

<p>"They are here."</p>

<p>"<i>Bien!</i> You vill all go back to ze camp and ze
ladees. You vill leave ze prisonaire; <i>aussi</i>, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
will leave ze Captain Goff wiz ze rope tie on hees

back on zis place, and you vill find ze longboat
wiz ze gasoline, ze provisionments, <i>et</i> ze compass
<i>et</i> ze sextant, to make ze voyage to La Guaira, to
Curaçao, to anyw'ere you like to gone. <i>Voila!</i> dat
ees all."</p>

<p>Again we took hasty counsel among ourselves,
and whatever design Goff had been nursing in
asking Van Dyck to prolong the parley was frustrated
by another turn of the launch's drift. The
boat was now edging farther out from the beach.
One and all we were for refusing the detailed terms
point blank, if for no other reason than that we
were required to leave one of our number bound
and at the mercy of the mutineers; one and all, I
say, but Goff himself said nothing.</p>

<p>"We can't consider the proposal in its entirety
for a minute," said John Grey, voicing the sentiments
of at least five of us. But now Goff cut in.</p>

<p>"You're my owner, Mr. Van Dyck: if I could
have a little over-haulin' of things with you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Van Dyck promptly went aside with the skipper.
They didn't go so far but what we could hear
their voices&mdash;though not the words&mdash;and Goff
seemed to be doing all the talking, and to be doing
it very earnestly. But when they came back, as
they did very shortly, it was Bonteck who told us
the outcome.</p>

<p>"Captain Goff has explained to me that the
mutineers are obliged to make the terms include
his surrender. Lequat is only a rule-of-thumb
navigator, and if they don't have Goff they are
likely to make a mess of themselves and of the
yacht. For the sake of those whom we must consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
first of all&mdash;the women&mdash;he is willing to take
his chance again as a prisoner. If I thought there
was any doubt about this fat devil carrying out
his threat to bombard the island, I'd say 'No,' and
fight for it. But we must remember that he can
hardly fail to get some of us with the gun, or, if
he shouldn't do that, he can keep us away from
our water supply until we all die of thirst."</p>

<p>Grey raised the only question that seemed to be
worth considering.</p>

<p>"We shall have only this scoundrel's word for
it that the long-boat and provisions will be left
for us," he objected.</p>

<p>Van Dyck put the suggestion aside hastily; rather
too hastily, I fancied.</p>

<p>"We are obliged to take some chances, of course.
Goff, here, will insist upon the fulfilment of the
treaty terms. If they are not fulfilled to the letter,
he will put the <i>Andromeda</i> on the reef and take
the consequences." Then he called once more to
the man in the boat: "One word with you before
we close this deal. This is piracy on the high seas.
I suppose you know what that means when you
are caught&mdash;as you will be, sooner or later?"</p>

<p>We could see a big arm waving in airy bravado.</p>

<p>"Eet is not'ing, Monsieur Van Dyck. I blow
it away&mdash;<i>pouf!</i> In Santa Cruz you vill h-ask ze
gr-r-eat liberador w'at he shall tell you about
'Gustave Le Gros.' W'en you shall h-ask heem
zat, you shall know it ees not'ing."</p>

<p>"All right," Bonteck returned. "We'll fall back
and leave the prisoners. Captain Goff will be
with them, and he will surrender when you come
ashore. But he will not be bound, and he will
be armed, so you can govern yourself accordingly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>The fat man waved an arm again and took up
his sculling oar, raising no objection to the single
modification of the ultimatum&mdash;that relating to
the way Goff should be left. We waited until we
saw the disabled launch creep out through the
gash in the reef. Then we fell back upon the professor,
who was still reading quietly by the miserable
light of the ship's lantern.</p>

<p>In a few words we explained the new situation,
and the mild-eyed rider of an engrossing hobby got
up and carefully dusted his trousers.</p>

<p>"You gentlemen were on the ground, and you
doubtless knew what was best to be done," he said
in gentle resignation. "Shall we go back to the
ladies?"</p>

<p>We left Elijah Goff to watch over the trussed-up
figures in the little open glade and set out upon
our retreat, taking the northern beach for our
route. Just before we came opposite the camp at
the farther end of the island, we heard the renewed
sputterings and poppings of the gasoline engine in
the long-boat. The amateur pirates were landing,
this time without let or hindrance.</p>

<h2>XVII<br />
<br />
<small>CAPTAIN ELIJAH SCORES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Reaching</span> the camp under the palms we found
a "state of affairs," as Conetta phrased it. The
small fire had been kindled&mdash;not for any needed
warmth, to be sure, but solely for the heartening
effect of it, I imagined&mdash;and the women were
huddled about it in various attitudes of more or
less hysterical suspense, for which there was undeniably
sufficient excuse, heaven knows.</p>

<p>There were sobs and gaspings of relief when we
came in with our original number undiminished;
and I let the others answer the inevitable outburst
of eager and anxious questions and drew Conetta
out of the fire circle to tell her briefly what had
transpired, and what we had failed to do.</p>

<p>"And those horrid men are actually on the
island with us now&mdash;at this very moment?" she
breathed, the slate-blue eyes dilating. "What
are they here for? What are they doing?"</p>

<p>"They have come to get the boat-load that we
captured; the six that Goff brought ashore,"
I evaded, still trying to keep Bonteck's foolish
secret intact.</p>

<p>"Then they will go away again?"</p>

<p>"That is one comfort; and very soon, I should
say."</p>

<p>"But I don't understand. If they are not going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
to take us in the <i>Andromeda</i>, why have they come
back to the island?"</p>

<p>I hated to go on prevaricating to her, but until
Bonteck should give me leave, I was not at liberty
to tell her the whole truth.</p>

<p>"Suppose we give them the credit of being at
least partly human," I suggested. "Possibly they
couldn't find it in their hearts to let us stay here
and famish slowly. You mustn't forget that
they've promised to leave us the long-boat and
some eatables."</p>

<p>I could see well enough that she wasn't satisfied
with that answer. She was far too clear-headed
to take any such niggardly part for the whole.</p>

<p>"You're not making it very plausible," she
said. "How far is it to where we're going in the
long-boat?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's quite some little distance," I replied,
as easily as I could. "But with the sea as calm
as it is now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It may not stay calm," she broke in; and then:
"You say Captain Elijah was with you. Where
is he now?"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;er&mdash;he had to let himself be taken again,
you know. The pirates insisted upon that. They
have no real navigator in their outfit. That is
probably the reason why they didn't put him ashore
with us in the beginning."</p>

<p>"Then Bonteck was right? Captain Elijah
wasn't one of them?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed. I'm frank to say I did him an
injustice. He was overpowered and made a prisoner,
along with Haskell and Quinby and the
other Americans."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"But why did that first six that you had the
fight with bring the captain ashore with them?"</p>

<p>Again I had to evade. "Goff didn't tell us
that."</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment. Then I got it hot
and heavy.</p>

<p>"Dick Preble, do you mean to stand there with a
face like a Hindoo idol and tell me that six of you
made a bargain with that wretched French cook
to give old Uncle Elijah up?"</p>

<p>"It was Goff's own proposal," I hastened to say,
"and he insisted upon it&mdash;wouldn't have it any
other way. Let us hope that he knew what he
was doing&mdash;that he has some plan that may turn
out better for us than a voyage in the long-boat."
Then I switched forcibly, endeavoring to drag the
talk away from the vicinity of Bonteck's secret.
Thus far it had been kept hidden through all the
various vicissitudes, and I didn't intend to be the
first to betray it. "Goff's play was heroic, and
all that, but not a bit more so than Jerry Dupuyster's
swim out to the yacht. I'm taking back
all the insulting things I've been saying about that
young man, Conetta, dear. In spite of the frills
and the idleness and the English apings, he is a
man, a grown man, and altogether worthy of a
good woman's love and respect. Now I've said
it and I feel better."</p>

<p>She looked up quickly, with that pert little
cocking of her head that I had always loved.</p>

<p>"Worthy of <i>my</i> love and respect, do you mean?"</p>

<p>I bowed. "Yes; that is what I mean."</p>

<p>"And you want me to marry him?" It was a
dreadful thing for her to ask at such a time and
in such a place, with the others almost within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
arm's-reach. But they were all talking at once,
and nobody was paying much attention to anybody
else.</p>

<p>"You are promised," I reminded her; "and if
you can forgive him for chasing around after
another woman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" she commanded, with a sudden retreat
into the arms of discreetness. "They will hear
you and say things about you&mdash;behind your back.
What are we to do now&mdash;just lie down and go
calmly to sleep, forgetting all about these horrid
pirates at the other end of our island? I can't
quite see us doing that. Can you?"</p>

<p>It was just here that Bonteck cut in, saving me
the necessity of answering.</p>

<p>"When you are quite through making Dick
jump the hurdles for you," he said to Conetta;
and then he explained. We were not to take the
mutineers wholly at their word regarding the
implied promise not to molest us. The six of us
who had been on the firing front were to do picket
duty while the others tried to get a little sleep.
The professor and Billy were to take the north
beach, Jerry Dupuyster and Grey the south, and
Bonteck and I were to vibrate between the two
beaches, keeping in touch with the shoreward
couples on either hand, thus maintaining a guard
line all across the island.</p>

<p>It was not until after this rather elaborate
picketing plan had been put in train, and Van
Dyck and I were cautiously feeling our way toward
the agreed-upon frontier half-way down the island,
that I ventured to find fault.</p>

<p>"I don't know why you should make six of us
unhappy when one or two would be enough," I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
complained. "You know well enough that our
fat cook is asking nothing but to be let alone until
he can make off with the loot. He's not going to
trouble us any more."</p>

<p>His reply was a cryptic generality.</p>

<p>"I am hoping we are not entirely through with
the fat cook, yet, Dick; in fact, I'm almost certain
we're not."</p>

<p>"What's gnawing at you now?" I asked sourly.</p>

<p>"Just a suggestion," he answered half-absently,
I thought. "We have something at our end of
the island that is much more valuable&mdash;and desirable&mdash;than
anything the pirates will find where
they are digging now."</p>

<p>The way in which he said it, as much as the
thing itself, made my blood run cold.</p>

<p>"The women, you mean?"</p>

<p>"It's only a suggestion," he hastened to say; "a
suggestion based upon a name. Let's forget it,
if we can."</p>

<p>We had groped our way for another hundred
yards before I said: "It's a beautiful muddle!
They won't find <i>your</i> gold&mdash;the whereabouts of
which seems to be a lot more mythical than any of
the old Spanish sea tales&mdash;and they <i>will</i> find the
tidy little fortune we turned up for Madeleine."</p>

<p>"Of course; they'll be sure to find that," he
agreed, still speaking half-absently.</p>

<p>"You talk as if you didn't care," I snapped.
"Is Madeleine's dilemma any less sharp pointed
now than it was when you cooked up this romantic
scheme of yours for helping her?"</p>

<p>"You shouldn't hit a man when he's down,
Dick," he replied soberly. "You know how I
was planning to play the god-in-the-car to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
little bunch of people, and what a chaotic, heart-breaking
mess I've made of it. With all sorts of
horrors staring us in the face, you can't blame me
if I go batty now and then. You'd do it yourself
if you were staggering under my load. I'm to
blame for all this, Dick; I, and nobody else."</p>

<p>It doesn't do any particular good to rub salt
into a wound&mdash;even a foolish wound. So I contented
myself with asking a sort of routine question:</p>

<p>"Does Madeleine know how she is being robbed?"</p>

<p>"She does. I was obliged to tell her that much."</p>

<p>"How did she take it?"</p>

<p>"Like the angel that she is, Dick. She says the
gold doesn't belong to her, any more than it does
to anybody else who might dig it up; and that,
anyway, it doesn't matter when there are so many
more important things at stake."</p>

<p>"She is quite right about that," I agreed. "With
a chancy voyage in an open boat ahead of us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll never make that voyage, Dick," he said
solemnly. "I think you know that as well as I do."</p>

<p>"Why won't we?"</p>

<p>"Because we are never going to be given the
chance. You are not confiding enough to believe
that this fat devil is going to keep his promise,
to us, are you?"</p>

<p>"But, good heavens&mdash;you're keeping our promise
to him, aren't you?" I burst out.</p>

<p>"To the letter&mdash;exactly and precisely to the
letter," was his calm reply. "You heard what
the Frenchman asked, and what I agreed to.
He made three conditions; we were to go back to
our camp; he was to be permitted to land in peace;
and Goff was to be given up. We have kept faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
in all three particulars. But he isn't meaning to
keep faith with us at all."</p>

<p>"You mean that he won't leave us the boat?"
I gasped.</p>

<p>"Not on your life. Goff told me we couldn't
put the slightest dependence in anything he might
say; and if I had been inclined to give him the
benefit of the doubt over Goff's warning, his own
boasting would have turned the scale against him.
Did you remark what he said, just as he was
leaving?&mdash;about Santa Cruz and the liberator?"</p>

<p>I don't know why the fat man's boast hadn't
made the proper impression upon me when he
shrilled it out at us, or why I had failed to recall
the name he had given as that of a Nicaraguan
bandit whose cruelty and rapacity had long been
a byword in the Central American republics.
There must have been a blind spot in my memory
at the moment, for the name and ill fame of Gustave
the Fat were known even in distant Venezuela.</p>

<p>"That fiend!" I choked. And then: "You
never shipped Gustave Le Gros in New York as
cook on the <i>Andromeda!</i>"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. We shipped the real Bassinette,
doubtless. Where and how the change was made&mdash;unless
our repair stop at Gracias á Dios gave them
their chance&mdash;I don't know."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," said I. "Isn't it occurring
to you now that the Gracias á Dios stop might
have been prearranged? Haskell couldn't account
for that propeller shaft running dry, and neither
could I, after I had examined it. It had every
appearance of having been tampered with; sand or
some other abrasive put into it. If such a thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
were done, and timed so that we'd have to put in
at Gracias&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sure!" he replied. "And the gold&mdash;my gold&mdash;was
probably the main-spring of the whole plot.
The secret of it must have leaked out some way
in New York, and it was handed on to this bandit
bunch; with Lequat to trail us, first to Havana,
and afterwards to New Orleans. But that's all
ancient history now. Our original job is still
before us, and that is not to let them get away with
the yacht and leave us as we were."</p>

<p>We had reached the appointed picket line, and
short detours to right and left put us in touch with
Dupuyster and Grey on the south beach and Sanford
and Billy Grisdale on the north. Grey had
scouted ahead a little way, and he told us that
the long-boat and the disabled electric launch were
lying at the beach at the place which had been our
late battle-ground, with two men guarding them.
And Grisdale and the professor had a similar report
to make concerning the mutineers' vigilance.
Billy had also made a forward reconnaissance,
and he had seen two sentries pacing back and forth
on the sands in the little indentation which we
had named "Spaniards' Bay."</p>

<p>Van Dyck made no comment until after we had
gone back to our mid-island post in the wood.
Then he said abruptly: "How long do you think
it will take them to dig up those gold bars and carry
them down to the boat, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know; with the number of men
they've probably got on the job it oughtn't to
take more than half an hour or so," I returned.</p>

<p>"Thirty minutes; it's short&mdash;frightfully short,"
he said, as if he were thinking aloud. Then;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
"It's this suspense that takes the heart out of a
man."</p>

<p>It seemed a little odd that he should lament the
shortness of the time in one breath, and in the
next give the impression that he wished it were
shorter.</p>

<p>"What difference does their speed or slowness
make to us?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It is just a chance&mdash;just the rawest of all
chances," he went on, ignoring my query. "I
suppose I ought not to have let it hang upon such
a weak thread; but there was no choice&mdash;no choice
at all."</p>

<p>"If you would describe the thread I might be
able to come a little nearer guessing what you are
talking about," I retorted.</p>

<p>"Goff has a plan of some sort, but he couldn't
take the time to go into details. As I've told you,
he warned me that no dependence whatever could
be placed upon the Frenchman's promise to leave
the long-boat and the provisions. He advised
me to accept the terms as they stood, and to make
a show of keeping our part of them&mdash;as we have.
Past that, we were to get in touch again, holding
ourselves in readiness for whatever might happen."</p>

<p>"And you don't know what is going to happen?"</p>

<p>"No more than you do. You know how secretive
Goff is, and, as I say, our time was short.
I can't, for the life of me, see what Goff can possibly
do to help out. I don't need to tell you the real
reason why Le Gros insisted upon our surrendering
him. He is the one man besides myself who
knows, or is supposed to know, where my gold
bars are buried, and Le Gros meant to make him
point out the spot&mdash;has probably done so before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
this time. What Goff hoped to gain by putting
himself into their hands, I don't know, but we
may be sure that he has some scheme in his clever
old head. He told me to watch the beaches, both
of them, and to be ready to bunch our fighting
half-dozen at any point, and at any minute."</p>

<p>"Well, we're here and we're ready," I said, and
the words were scarcely out of my mouth before
Grey came over from the southern beach, groping
his way blindly in the thicker darkness of the
palm shadows.</p>

<p>"Van Dyck&mdash;Preble!" he called cautiously, and
then he stumbled fairly into our arms. "Something
doing," he told us hurriedly. "One of the
boats&mdash;the smaller one&mdash;is adrift and moving
down this way. It doesn't seem to have anybody
in it."</p>

<p>"But I thought you said a few minutes ago that
there were two men guarding the boats," I struck in.</p>

<p>"There were, but they've gone somewhere.
Jerry and I supposed they were sitting down in
the tree shadows where we couldn't see them, but
I guess they must have gone up into the woods
with the others. If they were still on the beach
they wouldn't let that launch drift away without
trying to catch it."</p>

<p>"That drifting boat is probably our cue," said
Bonteck, instantly alert. Then to me: "Hurry
over to the other shore and get Sanford and Billy,
Dick&mdash;quick! Strike straight across the island
with them, and work your way along the south
beach until you find us!"</p>

<p>I established contact with the professor and
Billy without any difficulty and transmitted Van
Dyck's order. Billy wanted to know what good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the disabled electric launch would do us, even if
it should drift ashore at some point where we
could capture it, but I couldn't tell him that.</p>

<p>"That's a future," I said. "Our job just now is
to obey orders. Come on."</p>

<p>Together the three of us plunged into the wood
on a direct line across the island, and in a very
few minutes we found Van Dyck, Grey and Jerry
Dupuyster crouching in the shadows of the tree
fringe on the south shore. Far up the white line
of the beach we could see the dark bulk of the
long-boat at rest, and in the nearer distance was
the electric launch, still drifting down the lagoon
toward us.</p>

<p>"What's your guess, Dick?" said Van Dyck, as
we came up. "There isn't a particle of current
in that lagoon&mdash;you know there isn't."</p>

<p>There wasn't, as we had proved many times,
and yet the drifting boat was moving steadily in
our direction. It was Billy Grisdale's eyes&mdash;the
youngest pair of the half-dozen&mdash;that solved the
mystery.</p>

<p>"There's somebody in the boat&mdash;paddling,"
he declared. "Look steadily and you'll see his
arm reaching over the side. He's lying down or
kneeling so that you can't see anything but the
arm."</p>

<p>In a short time we could all see the propelling
arm making its rhythmic swing over the side of the
boat, and while we looked, the man in the boat
sat up and went at his task in more vigorous
fashion, beaching the boat presently in a small
cove within a stone's throw of our crouching place.</p>

<p>"It's Goff," said Van Dyck, when the paddler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
stepped out of the launch, and we made a rush for
him.</p>

<p>The old skipper had little enough to say for
himself, save that he had improved a chance to
slip away from the mutineers in the darkness,
and had stolen the launch with the idea of getting
it into our hands. Questioned by Grey as to how
he had been able to get away with the boat without
giving the alarm, the sailing-master gave such an
evasive reply that I was set to wondering if he
hadn't slain the two boat guards out of hand.
But as to that, he was too full of his plan for our
rescue to go into the particulars of his own adventure.</p>

<p>Briefly, the plan he had evolved turned upon
his success in securing one of the boats. For
obvious reasons he had picked upon the launch,
which the mutineers had towed ashore&mdash;probably
because there were men left on the <i>Andromeda</i> whom
they were afraid to trust and they wished to keep
in their own hands all means of communication
between the yacht and the island.</p>

<p>"Couldn't start the long-boat without that
pop-engine makin' a racket that'd wake the
dead," he explained; "and, besides, she's up on
the sand till it'll take half a dozen men to shove
her off. And the way they're out o' their heads,
I cal'lated they wouldn't miss the launch&mdash;not
first off, anyways."</p>

<p>"I suppose they've all gone crazy digging for
the Spanish gold," Bonteck said, meaning, as I
made sure, to give the captain a lead upon which
he was at liberty to enlarge in the hearing of the
rest of us.</p>

<p>"'Crazy' ain't a big enough word f'r it. You'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
think the whole kit and b'ilin' of 'em was just out
of a 'sylum. That's how it comes they hain't
missed me yet. But we'll have to talk sort o'
middlin' fast, I guess. When they do miss me,
I shouldn't wonder a mite if there'd be blood on
the moon. Now you've got a boat, what you goin'
to do, Mr. Van Dyck?"</p>

<p>With a boat, even a disabled one, in our hands
we were once more upon a fighting basis. Goff had
quickly confirmed Bonteck's assumption that Le
Gros hadn't the smallest idea of keeping his word
to us about the turning over of the long-boat, so
we were justified in declaring war again if we
chose. Bonteck's first proposal was to load our
fighting squad into the launch, in which we could
paddle our way through the nearest reef gap and
around to the <i>Andromeda</i>, on the chance of taking
the yacht by a surprise attack with Haskell and
his engine-room and stoke-hold contingent to
help us if we could contrive to liberate them.</p>

<p>To this expedient Goff raised a very pertinent
objection, which was immediately sustained by all.
While we should be fighting to gain possession of
the yacht, the women would be left practically
undefended on the island&mdash;hostages whom Le
Gros would immediately seize, and for the restoring
of whom&mdash;not to mention any worse thing that he
might do&mdash;he could exact any price he might ask
us to pay.</p>

<p>"No, that won't do," said Goff, when we were
brought up standing by the insurmountable objection;
"lemme get in with my notion. There's
three oars in the launch, and a piece of another.
By crowdin' the folks up a mite, you can get 'em
all in at one load. S'pose you do it, and paddle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
round outside o' the reef and board the yacht, the
whole kit and caboodle of ye. There won't be
much fightin' to do. That pirate's got most of
his bullies ashore with him. That's why he towed
the launch&mdash;didn't want to leave it behind f'r
the shaky ones to get hold of."</p>

<p>Van Dyck drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"That will do, if we're given time. But we
shan't have time, Captain 'Lige. Long before
we can paddle this dead weight of a tender down
to the other end of the island, get our people aboard,
and paddle back to the yacht with a load that will
put us fairly down to the gunwales, it will be too
late. The yacht will be gone."</p>

<p>"Meanin' that these scamps'll get through
with their job and beat you to it?" said the old
Gloucesterman. "I been figgerin' that it's my
job to see that they don't. While you're doin'
your little do, I'll tack back to that place up in
the woods and see if I can't keep 'em busy at the
diggin' f'r a while longer. If you folks can make
your turn and get things quieted down on the
<i>'Meda</i>, all you got to do then is to slip that anchor
cable quick as you can and put to sea. You're
a navigator, Mr. Van Dyck, and you can take
her anywhere that I could."</p>

<p>"And leave you behind in the hands of these
scoundrels who would burn you at the stake in
revenge?" Bonteck exclaimed; a protest that
was echoed instantly by every man of us. But
the brave old skipper wouldn't listen.</p>

<p>"There has come a time more 'n once afore
this when it was a ch'ice between one life and
a-many," he said, in his clipped New England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
drawl. "You folks go ahead and do your part,
and I'll do mine."</p>

<p>And before we could stop him he was gone.</p>

<h2>XVIII<br />
<br />
<small>UNDER A GIBBOUS MOON</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Being</span> thus committed by Goff's capture of the
electric launch to what promised to be the most
chanceful of all the hazards of that strenuous
night, we lost no time in setting about it. With
all the good will in the world, the old skipper might
not be able to do much for us in the way of delaying
the return of the mutineers to the <i>Andromeda</i>,
and it said itself that our one slender hope of success
lay in capturing the yacht while it was, in a certain
measure, undefended.</p>

<p>Luckily, the launch's painter was long enough to
serve as a tow line, and with five of us towing, and
Billy Grisdale steering against the shoreward drag
with an oar, we soon had the launch out of the
danger zone. Once fairly out of sight of the long-boat
and the beach of peril, we ran like flying
fugitives, as jealous of the flitting moments as a
miser of his gold. To save the utmost number of
these precious moments, Van Dyck and Jerry
Dupuyster dropped out of the towing rank after
we were well down toward the western end of the
island and cut across through the wood to arouse
the camp, leaving four of us to take the launch
around to the point at which the embarkation
could be most quickly made.</p>

<p>Having but a comparatively short distance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
go after Van Dyck and Jerry left us, we arrived
first at the agreed rendezvous, and I went aboard
the launch to try to determine how we were going
to handle and propel it with eighteen people crowded
into its narrow limits. As Goff had said, there
were three good oars, and the broken halves of
another; but rowing from the thwarts, with the
jammed lading we should have, was clearly out of the
question. And the alternative&mdash;two or three of
us standing up to use the oars as paddles&mdash;seemed
to be quite as clearly impracticable. If the launch
would suffice to float eighteen of us, trimming it as
carefully as we could and sitting as tight as the
shipwrecked sailors in the old song, we could
hardly ask more of it.</p>

<p>"Small room for so many of us, Mr. Preble&mdash;is
that what is troubling you?" asked the professor,
standing by while Grey and Billy Grisdale ran up
to the camp in the glade to hasten the laggards.</p>

<p>"Little space, and still less tonnage," I said.
"I'm doubtful if she will float all of us at once."</p>

<p>"Those useless storage batteries," he pointed
out; "they are quite heavy, aren't they? Can't
we lighten the boat by taking them out?"</p>

<p>It was a good thought, and I set about acting
upon it. But the batteries were built in snugly,
and without a wrecking tool of some sort they
could not be dislodged. There was a locker under
the stern sheets, and rummaging in this for tools,
I came upon a leather-cased object which proved
to be far more serviceable than any wrecking crow-bar.
It was an electric flashlight, and a touch of
the switch showed that its batteries were alive
and in working order.</p>

<p>"Let's have a look at this driving mechanism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
before we jettison it," I said; and the professor
held the light while I looked to see what Van Dyck's
disabling rifle shot had done to the motor.</p>

<p>To my great joy I found that the bullet had not
short-circuited the motor, as we supposed; it had
merely smashed the switch of the controlling
rheostat. Working rapidly while Sanford held
the flashlight, I was able to make a temporary
repair that would enable us to utilize the motor,
and I was giving the propeller shaft a few trial
turns when Van Dyck and Jerry, and Grey and
Billy came down to the beach with the hastily
gathered ship's company; sixteen of them and
the bull pup&mdash;for which latter Billy had been
shrewd enough to make Edie Van Tromp sponsor
and special pleader.</p>

<p>As I had feared we should be, the eighteen of us
and the dog were a frightful overload for the small
launch, this though Van Dyck had made the
fugitives leave every ounce of dead-weight behind
in the camp. In addition, there was honest terror
to make the hurried embarkation almost a panic.
We had no assurance that the mutineer-pirates
would take our quiescence for granted; we knew
they wouldn't if the loss of the launch should be
discovered. Every instant I was half expecting
to see the fat bandit and his mongrel crew burst
out of the shadowy wood to charge down upon us.
In which event, there would be a bloody massacre;
it could hardly be less.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the attack did not materialize.
In feverish haste we packed the small boat, with
beseechings to all and sundry to sit close and sit
tight, and even Ingerson, roused only a few minutes
earlier from his brutish sleep, helped as he could,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
planting himself stolidly at the launch's gunwale
and lending a hand like a man ashamed. When
we were ready to put to sea, and I had shoved off
and climbed in cautiously over the stern of the
heavily laden boat, it became quickly apparent
that the rehabilitation of the motor was the only
thing that made the venture even tentatively
possible. With the crowding there would have
been no slightest chance of using the oars in any
manner whatsoever.</p>

<p>I am quite sure that the memory of that perilous
boat voyage across the lagoon, out through the
nearest break in the reef and along the seaward
edge of the barrier coral to the point at which we
had our first sight of the <i>Andromeda</i> lying a bulking
gray shadow in the light of a gibbous moon which
was just rising, will stand out clear-cut for every
soul of our little ship's company long after all
other pictures have grown dim.</p>

<p>Happily for us, the sea was as quiet as an inland
lake; the open water hardly less than that of the
sheltered lagoon. In passing through the gap in
the reef the launch shipped a few bucketfuls, and
for the moment I thought we must founder&mdash;as
we should have if any one of us had stirred or
grown panicky. But upon giving the silent little
motor a bit more current we weathered the passage,
and out beyond, where the gentle swell lifted and
subsided evenly, we rode dry again.</p>

<p>It was after we had passed the miniature surf
line and were creeping eastward at the best speed I
dared give the launch that I whispered to Bonteck,
who was crouching with me over the motor controls.</p>

<p>"How much have you told the others?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing more than that we were going aboard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the yacht, and that there might be an attempt
made to drive us off."</p>

<p>"You could scarcely have said less. Is Goff
still holding the treasure hunters, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Something is holding them. We'd be hearing
from them if there wasn't."</p>

<p>"If we're lucky enough to reach the yacht without
being seen and fired upon, how are we going to get
aboard&mdash;with this crowd?"</p>

<p>"The accommodation ladder is down."</p>

<p>"I know. But it's on the starboard side&mdash;toward
the shore. We can't rush it, not if there
is any sort of defense&mdash;with the moon rising."</p>

<p>"Don't throw chocks under the wheels!" he
bit out. "It isn't a thing to be speculated upon;
it's a thing to be done!"</p>

<p>Somehow, I felt better after he said that. This
was the old Bonteck&mdash;the Bonteck I knew best&mdash;coming
to the front again, with the indomitable
spirit that had once made him a leader who never
knew when he was beaten&mdash;or rather a leader who
refused to be beaten. Like all the rest of us, he,
too, had suffered his sea-change and was the better
and bigger man for it.</p>

<p>Why we were not seen from the deck of the
yacht long before we could come within striking
distance was a circumstance for which we could
not at the moment account. As I have said, the
night was crystal clear; clearer, if possible, than
at that earlier hour when the <i>Andromeda</i> had come
creeping up out of the east. Besides, the shrunken
moon was now something more than a hand's-breadth
above the horizon, and while its light
was pale, it was enough to cast long shadows of the
motionless vessel far out toward us. Yet there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
was no stir on the yacht's decks, and no alarm
raised as our deeply laden boat stole along the
outer edge of the coral reef, giving the rocks only
so much margin as would serve to keep the low
gunwales out of the back wash of the slight swell
breaking over the barrier.</p>

<p>As we drew nearer, with the motor running as
silently as a murmur of bat's wings, we saw the
reason for our temporary immunity from discovery.
The treasure diggers were returning to the island
beach with their spoil, or rather they were coming
and going in a double procession, like an endless
chain of roustabouts loading a Mississippi River
steamboat, and, quite naturally, all eyes on board
the yacht would be turned in that direction. A
fire had been kindled on the beach to give light
for the loading of the gold bars into the long-boat,
and its red glow made boat and men and the
backgrounding jungle stand out with sharp distinctness.
Conetta, squeezed in next to Van
Dyck, leaned over to whisper: "Are we back in
the days of the old buccaneers? Have we been
only dreaming that we were living in the twentieth
century?"</p>

<p>"What you are seeing is no dream," said Bonteck.
"It's the real thing, and you'll probably never
look upon its like again." Then to me: "A little
more speed if she'll take it, Dick. They are
rushing that boat-loading business, and what we
do will have to be done swiftly or we'll be too late."</p>

<p>I gave the boat's motor another notch of the
electric throttle, and the bat's-wing murmur increased
to a low humming. As if drawn by invisible
hands the laden launch approached the
yacht's bow on the seaward side. The need for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
haste was pricking me as sharply as it was Van
Dyck, but prudent care came first. As matters
stood, we were as helpless as a packed pleasure
boat. One armed man at the yacht's rail could
have held us off, encumbered as we were. Until
we could have room in which to spread out a bit
we were like a lot of shackled prisoners. So,
when the yacht's bulk came between us and the
fire-lighted scene on the beach, I switched the
power off and let the launch drift by slow inchings
until Dupuyster, crouching in the bow, was fending
with his hands to keep us from bumping against the
side of the <i>Andromeda</i>.</p>

<p>So far so good. We had made contact, as the
modern militarists say, but what the next move
should be, I couldn't imagine. Above, and overhanging
us, since our point of contact was
under the flaring out-sheer of the yacht's bow,
stretched the smooth white wall of the <i>Andromeda's</i>
body plating, with the bulwarks and rail far
beyond the reach of the tallest of us. True, the
accommodation ladder had been let down on the
starboard side, and was probably still down; but
with the moon rising, and the light of the beach
fire playing full upon that side of the yacht, it
would be simply inviting defeat to try for that.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, we had an inspired leader,
and he knew exactly what he meant to do. Amidships
on our side of the yacht the davit falls by
which the long-boat had been lowered were still
hanging as they had been left when the boat was
put overside. Van Dyck passed a whispered word
to Dupuyster to hand the launch along toward
these hanging tackles, and I held my breath.
Quite possibly six of us&mdash;counting Ingerson as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of the half-dozen&mdash;were young enough and agile
enough to climb the tackles one at a time, but I
couldn't see the barest chance of carrying out any
such manoeuver as that with the overloaded
launch for a take-off.</p>

<p>"What's the notion?" I asked Van Dyck.
"We can't board by way of those boat tackles.
We shall swamp the launch, as sure as fate!"</p>

<p>"Wait," he whispered back. "You've forgotten
the coaling port."</p>

<p>His reminder was entirely justified. But if I
had remembered the two square openings, one on
either side of the ship, through which the bunkers
were filled, I should have dismissed their possibilities
at once. The rawest landsman in our
company would know that these openings would
be closed from the inside&mdash;closed and gasketed
and bolted to make them water-tight.</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;&mdash;" I began; but Van Dyck interrupted
quickly. We were nearing the hanging
tackles and he whispered his commands hurriedly.
"Here is the port," he said, pointing out the
joint lines of the coal opening. "Hand the
launch back to it after I'm gone." And, as the
boat falls came within reach: "Catch the tackle
and steady her, and be ready to trim ship when I
take my weight out."</p>

<p>Mechanically I grasped the ropes as we drifted
up to them, and with the cat-like agility of a practiced
sailor, Van Dyck lifted himself gently out of
our cockleshell and went up the dangling tackle
to disappear silently over the yacht's rail. His
purpose was evident enough now. He was going
to try to get below and open the fuel port for us.</p>

<p>Passing the word along to Dupuyster to hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the launch back to the coaling port, I helped as
I could with the blade of the broken oar. Motionless
presently under the outline of the square
opening, we entered upon a period of breathless
suspense. Being on the seaward side of things,
we could not see how the long-boat loading was
progressing, but every moment I was expecting
to hear the pop-pop of the gasoline motor which
would tell us that the gold robbers were putting
off for the yacht.</p>

<p>We could easily visualize the obstacles Bonteck
would have to overcome in trying to reach the
other side of the bunker port. He must make
his way undiscovered to the engine-room hatch&mdash;which
might or might not be guarded&mdash;get into
communication with the imprisoned engineers and
firemen and direct them to open the port for us.
Past that, it was entirely within the possibilities
that certain tons of coal might have to be moved
before the port could be opened&mdash;an undertaking
which would devour still more time, and which
could hardly be carried out without giving the
alarm to whatever ship's guard the fat pirate had
left on board.</p>

<p>Knowing all this, we waited in nerve-racking
trepidation, hardly daring to breathe. Once, while
we hugged the side of the yacht and held the
launch immovable, there were footsteps on the
deck above us. Hearing the faint click of a pistol,
I knew that Grey or Dupuyster or Billy Grisdale
was preparing for the worst, and I was in an agony
of apprehension lest one of them should fire before
this last-resort measure became actually necessary.
But the footsteps died away, and nothing happened.</p>

<p>All through this most trying wait, during which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
we could hear plainly the noises on shore, the
shouts and cries, the crackling of the fire, and the
men plunging through the bushes and dumping
their burdens into the long-boat, the fortitude
of the women huddled in our frail craft was heroic.
There was never a whisper or a murmur, that I
could hear. Only once, Conetta, whose place in
the launch, now that Bonteck was gone, was next
to mine, reached over and put a cold little hand in
mine.</p>

<p>It was Jerry Dupuyster who gave us the first
word of encouragement. At the risk of losing
his balance and going overboard he had laid an
ear against the <i>Andromeda's</i> side plating. "They're
working on it," was the whispered word that came
back to us in the breathless suspense; and a little
later the coaling port began to open by cautious
inchings to show us a widening breach in the
yacht's side.</p>

<p>It may easily say itself that there were thrillings
and breath-catchings a-many to go with that
desperate midnight unloading of the crowded
launch through the bunker opening in the <i>Andromeda's</i>
side. The coal port was fully man-head high
above the water line, and we had no anchorage
save our finger holds upon the edge of the opening.
How we managed it I hardly know. The women
had to be lifted and passed up one by one, and
I remember that it took two of us, Ingerson and
myself, to get Mrs. Van Tromp hoisted up to the
rescuing hands thrust out of the opening. I don't
suppose she weighed much above two hundred
pounds&mdash;no great weight for two able-bodied men
to handle&mdash;but our insecure footing easily added
another two hundred to the effort. While we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
labored, the increasing shore clamor told us that
our time was growing critically short, and in the
fiercer spurt of haste that ensued we came within
an ace of swamping our frail foothold.</p>

<p>"Quick!" said Bonteck, leaning far out to give
me a hand when I was the last man left in the
launch. But I had another thing in mind.</p>

<p>"Elijah Goff has set a good example and I'm
going to follow it," I whispered hurriedly. "There
is a chance that I can get this pushboat back to
the beach before the Frenchman finds out that it
is gone. If I succeed, you can take him unawares
when he comes off to the yacht and have the
advantage of a complete surprise. I'll be with
you when the clock strikes&mdash;if I don't get killed
too soon." And I shoved off before he could reach
down and grab me, as he tried to do.</p>

<p>With the silent electric drive turning at its
slowest speed, I edged the launch seaward, and
after a little distance was gained, gave the propeller
its full power. In our many patrollings of
the beach I had marked an opening through the
barrier reef at the extreme eastern end of the island,
and through this passage I presently drove the
launch, heading it down the lagoon toward the
pirates' landing place.</p>

<p>Hugging the shore, I made the approach as
cautiously as might be. Everything favored the
undertaking. The bonfire had been built a few
yards down-beach from the long-boat, and its
blaze served to make objects less easily discernible
in the wan moonlight outside of the ruddy zone
of firelight. The treasure diggers were carrying
the last of the precious cargo down from the wood,
and Le Gros himself was directing its loading with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
many gesticulations and a babblement of shrill
oaths. Slowly the launch drifted up to the stern
of the long-boat and I crawled forward and made
the painter fast. The thing was done.</p>

<p>It was done none too soon. There was barely
time for me to flatten myself in the bow of the
launch before the mutineers began to crowd into
the bigger boat. I had only time to make sure
that Goff was not among them before the popping
engine set up its clamor, and the fat chief flung
himself down beside the tiller, so near that I could
have reached up and touched him.</p>

<p>"Shove off, then, <i>mes braves!</i>" he yelled; and
in some confusion we got away and headed for
the yacht, the long-boat towing the presumably
empty electric launch.</p>

<p>Taking it as a matter of course that Van Dyck
and the others, with the help of Haskell and the
liberated prisoners, had by this time gained possession
of the <i>Andromeda</i>, I had an exceedingly
bad half-minute when, as the long-boat lost way
at the foot of the accommodation ladder, Le Gros
got up, stumbled forward, and climbed the ladder
to the yacht's deck, unopposed, and, taking his
place at the rail, began to screech out his orders
to the boat's crew. What had happened during
my brief absence? Had somebody discovered the
presence of our boarding party and clapped the
hatch down upon it before Van Dyck could lead
it out of the bunker hold? It looked very much
that way.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my own situation had suddenly
become embarrassing, not to say perilous. I had
confidently expected to see the fat villain surrounded
and overpowered the moment he set foot on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
yacht's deck. Since nothing of the kind had taken
place, I knew it could be only a few minutes at the
farthest before I should be discovered and either
summarily knocked on the head or thrown to the
sharks&mdash;or both. Yet there was nothing to be done,
or if there were, it didn't occur to me, though, as
the dullest imagination would prefigure, I was
trying mighty hard to make it occur.</p>

<p>While I crouched and cowered in the bottom of
the launch, endeavoring to make myself look as
much as possible like a heap of cast-off clothes,
the unloading of the gold bars was begun, with the
fat fiend leaning over the yacht's rail to shrill
curses at his men. This time there was no roustabout
procession. <i>Sacré</i>-ing and swearing like a
man possessed, Le Gros got his crew strung out
in a long line leading from the accommodation
grating up the ladder and forward to some point
on the yacht's fore-deck, and along this line the
gold ingots were passed from hand to hand. Judging
from the internal thunderings that began when
the mounting stream of heavy chunks of metal
got fairly in motion, I gathered that the fore-hold
was to be made to serve as the pirates' strong-room.
And still our attacking party, if we had
one, made no move.</p>

<p>I was sweating like a patient in the hot room of a
Turkish bath when the last of the apparently interminable
string of gold bars went up the ladder and
the fat bandit gave the order which proved his
calculated perfidy, and, incidentally, let me know
that my time was come.</p>

<p>"Br-ring dose boat to ze davit and 'oist dem
aboard!" he commanded; and then, as if this final
order had been the signal for which it had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
waiting, pandemonium broke loose on the <i>Andromeda's</i>
fore-deck. A confused clamor of shots,
yells, curses and bludgeon blows rose upon the
midnight air, and, hasten as I might and did, the
battle was as good as fought and won before I
could clamber over the long-boat and dart up the
ladder and hurl myself into it.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the deck I saw that I might
have spared myself a large share of the anxieties
if I had had a little more confidence in Van Dyck's
gift of leadership. Like a good general he had
been merely waiting for the propitious moment.
He had posted his force, which included, besides
the engineers and firemen, a good handful of the
Provincetown Portuguese who had yielded only
to force of numbers when the mutineers took the
yacht, at various points of advantage, and choosing
the instant when, with its job completed, the
long-boat's crew was hurrying forward to man the
hand winch and get the anchor up, the yacht's
searchlight was turned on and the rush was made.
When I got in, the <i>Andromeda's</i> fore-deck was&mdash;well,
not exactly a shambles, perhaps, but something
resembling a bull-ring after the banderilleros
and picadores and chulos have been tossed hither
and yon and butted and horned into cowering
submission, with Van Dyck just tackling the fat
chief in a whirlwind grapple that brought assailed
and assailant to the deck with a crash that was like
the fall of a house.</p>

<p>"What have you done with Captain Goff?"
bellowed the victor in the grapple, with his knee
in the fat one's stomach; and from the gurgling
sounds that issued we gathered that the stout-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
old Gloucesterman had been made to pay a
bitter penalty for his loyalty to us.</p>

<p>"'Ee is mak' us to deeg wiz ze peek-axe in ze
wr-rong places!" gasped the fat bandit in extenuation.</p>

<p>Van Dyck got up and turned Le Gros over to
Haskell and two of the Portuguese, who proceeded
to tie him and truss him like an enormous fowl.</p>

<p>Bonteck wheeled upon me.</p>

<p>"Dick, take a couple of our men in the launch
and go after the old skipper. If they've killed
him, I'm going to be judge, jury and sheriff for
this fat devil and every man who stood in with
him!" he raged. And I went quickly, taking two
of Haskell's men to help.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Le Gros and his accomplices,
upon whom I am sure Van Dyck would have
wreaked a swift and terrible vengeance, Goff was
not dead. So far from it, when we reached the
inland glade, where the forgotten ship's lantern
still spread its little circle of yellow light, we found
the old man on his knees in one of the numerous
shallow holes dug by the gold-seekers, clawing the
earth with his bare hands like a crazy old marmot.
He had been brutally mishandled and was covered
with blood, but when we laid hold of him and
dragged him out of his burrow, he fought us madly
to get back.</p>

<p>"Mr. Van Dyck's gold&mdash;it's gone, slick and
clean!" he croaked. "I cal'late I've got to find
it afore I c'n go aboard."</p>

<p>My two helpers took his mutterings for the
ravings of a man who had been beaten and left
for dead&mdash;as they were in good part&mdash;and among
us we pacified him and got him down to the launch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Van Dyck was at the foot of the accommodation
ladder when we reached the yacht, so I had a
chance to give him a cautionary word.</p>

<p>"Keep the old man quiet until he comes to
himself," I warned. "If you don't, he'll publish
your little gold-bar plot to the whole ship's company,"
and I briefed the pathetic little scene we
had broken in upon when we found Goff.</p>

<p>"Plucky old duffer!" said Bonteck warmly,
when Quinby and his mate had half led and half
carried Goff up the ladder. "I've been telling
you all along that he was the right sort. But
come aboard. We're going to hold a drumhead
court-martial and try these amateur pirates right
here and now."</p>

<p>"You don't need me for that," I objected.
"Let me have a couple of the Portuguese sailormen
and I'll take the long-boat and go around to our
abandoned camp for the dunnage we left behind."</p>

<p>"Oh, damn the dunnage&mdash;let it go!" he broke
out impatiently; but he changed his tune when I
reminded him that since the abandoned luggage
was made up chiefly of the women's steamer trunks,
it would be wise for us to salvage it if only in the
interests of peace and quietness.</p>

<p>"All right; go to it," he yielded; and after I had
picked my crew of two, I took the long-boat and
set about the salvaging.</p>

<p>It was a short horse, soon curried. The gasoline
boat was fairly speedy, and the run down the lagoon
was quickly made. With two huskies to do the
porterage, little time was lost in stripping the
camp of everything that was worth carrying away,
and well within the hour we were back at the
<i>Andromeda's</i> accommodation ladder. Waiting only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
long enough to see the trunks going overside in a
whip tackle that had been rigged for the purpose,
I went aboard and found that the sea court had
been in session, that the yacht's anchor was catted,
and that the stage was set for the final act in the
drama of the night of alarms.</p>

<p>"We were waiting for you&mdash;or rather for that
long-boat," said Van Dyck, after I had climbed to
the bridge from which he was directing the luggage
bestowal.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Wait and you will see," he replied; and then he
told me the findings of the drumhead court. The
mutineers, with Le Gros for their leader, were
members of a Central American revolutionary
junta which had its headquarters in New York.
At first, the intention had been to capture the
<i>Andromeda</i> and use her as a means of transportation
for arms and ammunition, and, as Goff had told us,
one cargo of the munitions had already been carried
and landed. But the secret of Van Dyck's buried
gold&mdash;which, as it appeared, was no secret at all
so far as Lequat and the bandit chief were concerned&mdash;had
brought them back to the island.</p>

<p>"Goff says they made no bones about telling
him that they were killing time in the ammunition
shipment, with the cold-blooded purpose of letting
us starve in the interval," Van Dyck said in conclusion.
"It was not Le Gros's intention to give us
any provisions at all when we were marooned, but
Goff, who was shrewd enough not to make any
resistance when he found it would be useless,
overpersuaded him."</p>

<p>"How could he do that?"</p>

<p>"Very easily. He told Le Gros about my silly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
plot, and showed him how, if that plot were carried
out exactly as it had been planned, the secret of
the real mutiny could be kept indefinitely. He
argued, quite plausibly, as you will see, that in due
course of time I would be obliged to confess my
plot, in which case, even if we should chance to be
rescued by some passing ship, the onus would still
rest upon me."</p>

<p>I laughed. "The old skipper is something of a
plotter himself, and we all owe him a lot more
than we can ever pay. What are you going to
do to these pirates?"</p>

<p>"I gave Gustave his choice; to be landed, with
his fellow bandits, at the nearest port of call where
his country has a consul, or to be set ashore here on
the island."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" I ejaculated. "Surely it didn't
take him long to decide against the excellent chance
of starving to death in this horrible death trap!"</p>

<p>Van Dyck's smile was grim.</p>

<p>"No; the deciding part of it didn't take him long."
He led me to the starboard bridge-end and pointed
to the accommodation ladder, where the mutineers,
in single file, and each man carrying his allotment
of provisions in a sack, were descending to take
their places in the long-boat&mdash;this under an armed
guard with Haskell and Quinby in command.</p>

<p>"They know the tender mercies of their countrymen,"
Bonteck went on, "and they elected, very
promptly, to take the chance they made us take,
rather than to be turned over to the authorities.
The name of the island fits, after all; it is still
'Pirates' Hope,' you see. Just the same, I'll
drop a word somewhere to have them picked up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
after they've served their time for stealing my
yacht."</p>

<p>The anchor, broken out by the hand capstan, was
apeak, and the blowers were roaring in the <i>Andromeda's</i>
tall funnels when the long-boat returned, to
be quickly hoisted to its chocks on the roof of the
deck-house. Van Dyck had the wheel, and at his
signal to the engine-room the big propellers began
to thrash in the backward motion and the yacht
drew away from her late anchorage. I stood by
until the miniature liner was set upon her course
and was leaving the island astern. Then I took
the wheel forcibly out of Bonteck's hands.</p>

<p>"You've had it harder than any of us, and I
couldn't go to sleep if my life depended upon it,"
I told him. "If you'll give me the course, I'll
take the first trick and you can relieve me after
you've had your forty winks."</p>

<p>He protested generously, of course, but yielded
at last when he found me obstinate. After he
left me, I signaled the engine-room for full speed
ahead and a few minutes later turned the wheel
over to one of our Portuguese loyalists whom Van
Dyck had sent up to act as my steersman. Freed
thus from the mechanical duty, I took time for a
backward look. The white ribbon of beach, with
its dot of fire surrounded by a huddle of motionless
figures, had disappeared, and the island itself was
becoming a mere blot dimly outlined in the pale
moonlight. It was like the waving of the magic
wand in an extravaganza. By a few score revolutions
of the <i>Andromeda's</i> twin screws we had been
whisked out of the age of romance and daring-do
to be set down once more among the common-places&mdash;and
conventions&mdash;of the twentieth Christian
century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>




<h2>XIX<br />
<br />
<small>THE FORWARD LIGHT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Dawn</span> was just breaking over a sea that was like
a caldron of half-cooled molten metal for its colorings
when Van Dyck came to take his turn on the
<i>Andromeda's</i> bridge, and he rated me soundly for
not having called him earlier.</p>

<p>"It is one thing to be generous, and quite another
to be a self-immolating ass," was one of the compliments
he handed me. Then: "By a streak of
luck, one of our Portuguese fishermen turns out to
be a passable cook. Get below and you'll find
breakfast of a sort waiting for you in the saloon.
Fill up, and then go to bed and sleep until you've
caught up with the procession."</p>

<p>Being by this time in a receptive mood on both
counts, I obeyed the double injunction literally,
and ten seconds after rolling, full-stomached, into
the comfortable bunk in the stateroom which
had been mine before the age of romance took us in
hand, I was dead to the world and so continued
while the clock-hands made a complete revolution,
with some hour or so added thereto.</p>

<p>When I awoke it was pitch dark in the little
stateroom cabin, and somebody was knocking at
the door. It proved to be Fernando, the new cook,
and he was telling me in broken English that he
had my dinner on a tray, by which I was made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
understand that I had slept past the regular
dinner hour.</p>

<p>Turning out for a bath, a shave, and the first
change of clothing that had been vouchsafed me
in many a long day, I ate the hand-in dinner with
the ravenous appetite of the half-famished, and
fared forth. Stepping into the brightly lighted
saloon, it was hard to realize that Pirates' Hope
and all that it stood for in the lives of eighteen of
us had ever existed.</p>

<p>If the mutineers had left any traces of their
short reign in our dining saloon they had all been
carefully expunged. At one of the sections of
the divisible dining-table Mrs. Van Tromp, Aunt
Mehitable, Madeleine Barclay's father and Ingerson
were playing bridge. Through the open door of
the smoking-room opposite I could see Major
Terwilliger lounging at ease in the deepest wicker
chair, with a glass and a bottle and the ingredients
for mixing his favorite after-dinner beverage on the
card table at his elbow. At another section of
the divisible dining-table the professor and his
wife were at work classifying a lot of leaves and
roots gathered on the island.</p>

<p>Down the companion stair came the tinkle-tinkle
of Billy Grisdale's mandolin to tell me that
the younger members of the ship's company had
already slipped back into the aforetime habit of
whiling away the evenings under the after-deck
awning. I smiled as I went forward to look for
Van Dyck, and the smile wasn't as cynical as it
might have been on the other side of the island
avatar. The prompt rebound to the normal and
the conventional was merely an example of human
nature at its most resilient&mdash;and best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Van Dyck was on the bridge, or, more strictly
speaking, in the little chart room, pricking out the
yacht's course with a pair of dividers, and one of
the Provincetown loyalists was at the wheel.</p>

<p>"You, Dick?" Bonteck said, when I drifted
in and took the stool across from him. "Had a
good nap?"</p>

<p>"If I haven't, it wasn't your fault," I returned.
"Whereabouts are we by this time?"</p>

<p>"Off the Venezuelan coast, and only a few hours
run from La Guaira. It's the majority vote of
the ship's company that we ought not to be cheated
out of the best part of our winter cruise, and we'll
put in at La Guaira and take a run up to Caracas
while Goff is refitting the yacht and laying in
stores. I hope that falls in with your notion."</p>

<p>I let my vote stand over until I could ask about
Goff.</p>

<p>"Uncle Elijah isn't out of commission, then?"</p>

<p>"Uncle Elijah is made of better stuff than most
of us younger fry. He'll be up and around in a
day or so; wanted to get up to-day and take over
his job, but I wouldn't let him. But how about
you? Will the La Guaira stop fit in with your
longings?"</p>

<p>"Admirably. There is a revived copper mining
prospect about to be exploited near Aroa, and with
your kind permission I'll quit you at La Guaira
and run over to Tucacas. There's a railway from
that port to Aroa, and I heard, while I was waiting
for you in New Orleans, that there might be an
opening for an American engineer."</p>

<p>"Um," he grunted, without looking up, "so
you're planning to desert, are you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you call it desertion, yes. I know when
I've had enough, Bonteck."</p>

<p>"I don't think you do," he said with a queer
grimace. "But let that stand over for a minute
or so. Don't you want to be brought up to date
in the treasure-trove adventure? I should think
you would."</p>

<p>"If there is anything remaining that I haven't
seen and felt and tasted," I returned.</p>

<p>"There is," he chuckled. "As the older novelists
would remark, the half has not been told. Item
Number One is a small problem in arithmetic.
You helped me dig up Madeleine's ransom, and
you counted the pieces, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"You'd be willing to go into court and swear
that there were forty of the gold bars; no more
and no less; wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>"I should."</p>

<p>"And we dug them all out&mdash;all there were in
that particular spot, didn't we?"</p>

<p>"I thought we did."</p>

<p>"Good. So did I. Yet the fact remains that
there are eighty-three gold bars safely stowed
away in the yacht's fore-hold; forty of one kind
and forty-three of another. How do you account
for that?"</p>

<p>I laughed. "It simply means that Le Gros was
more thorough than we were. He found your
planting, as well as that of the <i>Santa Lucia's</i> crew."</p>

<p>"He did. But the double find was due to
Goff's effort to gain time for us, rather than to
the fat bandit's thoroughness. When we left
Goff waiting for his recapture, the first thing he
did was to heave the chunk of coral out of the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
so that there wouldn't be any landmark. Then,
when Le Gros and his men came, Goff pointed
out first one place and then another, until he had
them digging all over the glade. That is why
they beat him so savagely; and it was after he
was knocked out that they stumbled upon both
hoards."</p>

<p>"Both in the same place?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Goff says they were not. He was just coming
back to consciousness when they were starting to
carry the stuff down to the beach. There were
two heaps of it. In his battered condition Goff
didn't realize the truth; he merely thought he
was seeing double. Afterward, so he says, he got
a crazy notion in his head that the pirates hadn't
found my gold at all, and that it was up to him to
find it. That was what he was trying to do when
you went after him."</p>

<p>"I know," I said; "Are there any more knots
in the tangle?"</p>

<p>"Just one. When I went below last night to
turn in, Billy Grisdale was waiting for me with
tears in his eyes; said he'd lost all his hopes of
heaven, and begged me to turn back to the island
and let him have men enough to go ashore and dig
some more in the gold plantation&mdash;that we were
leaving Edie's dowry behind. I asked him what
he meant, and he told me. He and Edie had
been the first to take fire when I told the old story
of the Spanish treasure ship, and they had gone
about looking for landmarks and digging haphazard
in one place and another."</p>

<p>"And, of course, they stumbled upon the chunk
of coral, rolled it away, and dug under it," I filled
in, recalling instantly what Billy had said to me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
about buried treasure and the ownership thereof
on the night of Ingerson's attempted suicide.</p>

<p>"You've said it. Naturally, it was my planting
that they uncovered&mdash;not the Spaniards', but
never having so much as heard of my earlier visit
to the island, there was nothing to make them
suspect that it was not the <i>Santa Lucia</i> hoard
that they had unearthed. Their first impulse
was to run back to camp and shout the good news;
but the cannier second thought prevailed. They
reburied the stuff in the hole they had made, marked
the place as well as they could&mdash;but not with the
chunk of coral they had rolled aside,&mdash;and came
away and left it, meaning to part with their secret
only when a rescue ship should come along."</p>

<p>"What did you tell Billy?"</p>

<p>He grinned. "I took him into the fore-hold
and showed him the pile of gold bars. As you
would imagine, he was paralyzed when he counted
and found there were eighty-three of them. 'There
were forty-three&mdash;I'm sure there were only forty-three,'
he kept saying over and over."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," I interposed; "you are going
too fast for me. Are you asking me to believe
that it was only by chance that they rolled the
piece of coral over to the exact spot where, we may
suppose, it originally stood&mdash;marking the place
of the <i>Santa Lucia</i> burial?"</p>

<p>"Chance and nothing else&mdash;excepting, perhaps,
it may have rolled more easily that way than any
other. It was Goff and I who moved it in the
first place, you remember, when we took it to mark
our gold grave."</p>

<p>"Now we may come back to Billy," I said. "What
more did you tell him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"What could I tell him, save to hint that the
Spaniards might have split their treasure and buried
it in two places?&mdash;that, and to josh him a bit for
having stopped too soon in his digging venture?"</p>

<p>"Then you told him that the remaining forty
pieces belong to Madeleine?"</p>

<p>"I did; I have told them all. She found it, and
it is hers. More than that, I have taken Jack Grey
into my confidence in the matter of Barclay's
shortage in his guardian accounts, and he will see
to it that the Vancourt trust fund is made whole
again."</p>

<p>"But, see here," I protested; "that is <i>your</i>
quarter million that Billy and Edie are making off
with!"</p>

<p>He laughed boyishly.</p>

<p>"I'm robbed," he declared; "Held up and
cleaned out in the house of my friends. I couldn't
claim the stuff if I wanted to&mdash;without giving
the whole snap away. But I don't mean to claim
it. It is going to be put right where it will do the
most good, Dick&mdash;which it wasn't going to be, if
my romantic plot had worked out as it was planned.
If Madeleine had found <i>my</i> money, I should
never have been able to look her straight in the
eyes again&mdash;never in this world. You know I
shouldn't. That was the weak detail I told you
about. But what she did find is her own, her very
own, you see; and mine goes to the two kiddies.
Billy's father couldn't stake him, neither now nor
two or three years hence, when these two babies will
take things into their own hands and get married,
money or no money. And with another of her girls
due to marry a poor man, Mrs. Van Tromp would
be in despair."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Another of her girls&mdash;you mean Beatrice?" I
asked, dry-lipped.</p>

<p>"Sure thing. Jerry's a pauper; or if he isn't
quite that now, he will be when Major Terwilliger's
last will and testament is read."</p>

<p>"But Conetta!" I gasped. "He is promised to
her, Bonteck."</p>

<p>"Is he?" he said; and that is all he did say.</p>

<p>"Isn't he?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"How should I know? You'd better go and ask
him or her&mdash;or both of them."</p>

<p>For a flitting instant I found myself desperate
enough to do that very thing; but I, too, had
suffered my sea change. Curiously enough the
hotheaded impulse died within me before I could
rise from my seat on the three-legged stool.</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you?" Van Dyck inquired
satirically, meaning, I supposed, why didn't I go
and make a fool of myself to the two people in
question. Then: "What has come over you,
Richard? Have you lost all of that fiery impetuosity
that used to make you the worry of your friends,
and put the fear of God into your enemies?"</p>

<p>It wasn't worth while to answer the gibe. I had
other and better things to think of just then.
Mellowing things.</p>

<p>"I know now why you dragged me in on this
winter cruise, Bonteck," I said, humbly enough.
"In the goodness of your heart you thought
Conetta and I might be able to bridge the three-year
gap and come together again. It was a kindly
thought, and I shall always remember it. It
wasn't your fault that the chance came too late.
Don't you want me to take your trick here and let
you go down to the others? True, Ingerson was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the bridge table when I came through, but he may
not stay there."</p>

<p>"Ingerson is out of it," he said shortly. "He
leaves us at La Guaira, to take the regular steamer
for Havana and home."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, my offer holds good. Give me
the course and I'll relieve you."</p>

<p>"Later on, perhaps; the night is yet young.
Just now, you'll be wanting to get Conetta and
Jerry together so you can fire that question of
yours at them. Better toddle along and have it
over with, while the thing is fresh in your mind."</p>

<p>I turned to go, but at the door of the chart-room
I paused to give him his due.</p>

<p>"You are a kindly sort of villain, after all, Bonteck,"
I said. "But how about the little experiment
in the humanities that was at the bottom of all
these things that have happened to us? Did it
turn out as you expected it would? Are we worse
than you feared&mdash;or better than you hoped?"</p>

<p>"Neither, Dick," he returned quite soberly.
"We are all pretty much the same, I guess; brothers
and sisters under the skin; just men and women 'of
like passions'. I think I've known it as well as I
needed to, all along, but it suited my humor to pose
as a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As a pragmatic ass," I snorted, helping him out.
"Whenever you are tempted to bray again&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll just think back a few lines and remember
this little Caribbean slip-up," he laughed. "But
don't let me keep you. I know you are perishing to
go and stick pins into poor old Jerry and Conetta."</p>

<p>That final remark of his was as far as possible from
the truth; so far, indeed, that, upon leaving the
bridge, I descended to the main deck by way of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
forward ladder for the express purpose of keeping
out of the way of the group under the awning on
the after-deck lounge.</p>

<p>Since the <i>Andromeda</i> was now quite short-handed,
the forward deck was deserted by all save a single
man at the bow. I crossed to the port rail and
stood for a time looking out upon the starlit sea
and listening to the sibilant song of the yacht's
sharp cutwater as it sheared its way through the
gently heaving seas.</p>

<p>I had not been talking merely for effect in
telling Bonteck that I should leave the yacht at
La Guaira. On all accounts it seemed only the
just and decent thing to do. Now that I came to
think of it soberly, it seemed quite possible that
my presence in the yacht party might have been
the provoking cause of Jerry Dupuyster's disloyalty,
or apparent disloyalty, to Conetta. He
knew that we had once been engaged, and while
there had been no more than fellow-passenger
intimacy on the cruise, we had been together more
or less on the island.</p>

<p>Though it was removed by the better part of the
length of the ship, the tinny tinkle of Billy's mandolin
was still audible, and presently there were
voices joining in a rollicking college song; John
Grey's clear tenor, Alicia Van Tromp's rich contralto,
and even the professor's bass. It seemed
incredible that the reaction from our late privations
could have swept us all so swiftly back to the
ordinary and the commonplace; and yet the fact
remained: a fact demonstrating beyond all question
the irresistible impulse in the normal human
being to revert quickly to the usual and the accustomed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps it was the reflective mood to which this
philosophizing vein led that made me insensible
of Conetta's approach. At any rate, I had no
warning; I was still supposing that she was with
the others on the after-deck when I felt her touch
on my arm.</p>

<p>"You?" I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, me," she admitted, with the cheerful disregard
for grammar which usually marked her
flippant moods. "What are you doing up here,
all by yourself?"</p>

<p>"What should I be doing? But if you really
want to know, I'm gazing out toward the country
where I'm likely to spend the next few years of my
life&mdash;Venezuela."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said quite calmly. "I've just been
up on the bridge with Bonteck. He told me you
were going to bury yourself again in the South
American wilds." Then, with what seemed to be
a tinge of mocking malice: "Is it the Castilian
princess?&mdash;but no; you told me she is married,
didn't you?"</p>

<p>"No," I returned crabbedly; "it's you, this time,
Conetta. I don't want to be on the same side of
the earth with you when you marry Jerry Dupuyster."</p>

<p>She laughed as though I had said something
humorous. "Jerry!" she scoffed. "Where are
your eyes, Dickie Preble? Don't you see that I
haven't the littlest chance in the world in that
quarter? I should think you might."</p>

<p>"That is all right," I retorted. "I'll have a
thing or two to say to Jerry before I quit this
neat little ship at La Guaira!"</p>

<p>"Please don't!" she pleaded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't tell Jerry where to head in, you mean?"</p>

<p>"No; I didn't mean that. I mean please don't
slip back, like all the rest of us have. Don't you
know you were awfully dear while we were on the
island? There were times&mdash;times when you were
so patient and good with Aunt Mehitable&mdash;when
I could have hugged you."</p>

<p>"Humph! I wonder what Jerry would have
said to that?"</p>

<p>"Can't we leave Jerry out of it, just for a few
minutes? But you <i>were</i> good, you know, and you
were really making me begin to believe that your
horrible temper, the temper that once made us both
pay such a frightful price, was your servant instead
of your master."</p>

<p>"Temper?" I said, fairly aghast at this bald
accusation.</p>

<p>"Yes, temper. Have you been like everybody
else&mdash;unable to recognize your own dearest failing?
Don't you know that even as a little boy they
used to say of you that you'd rather fight than
eat? Are all red-headed men like that?"</p>

<p>"Never mind the other red-headed men," I
returned. "What price did my temper make us
pay?&mdash;and when?"</p>

<p>"I wonder if you went through it all without
knowing&mdash;without realizing?" she said musingly.
"Do you remember one night when you were
taking Aunt Mehitable and me to the theater and
some lobby lounger made a remark that you didn't
like?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember it. I would have killed the
beast if they hadn't pulled me off him. That
remark was made about you, Conetta."</p>

<p>"I know. But you&mdash;you scandalized poor Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Mehitable. She began to say, right then, that
I could never hope to have a happy married life
with a man who had such an ungovernable temper.
Wasn't it more or less true, Dick?"</p>

<p>Back of the island period and its tremendous
revelations I should probably have said that it
wasn't true. But now I only asked for better
information.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time your aunt made two wills;
made one, and revoked it with another within a
week. Was that done to find out how much I
would stand for?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'm afraid it was." She admitted it reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Since it is all dead and buried long ago, you
might tell me a little more about it. What she
said to me was that she had heard of the loss of my
property, and that she thought it was only fair to
tell me that, under the terms of her will, you
wouldn't inherit anything but a small legacy.
She added that, of course, under such conditions
our marriage was out of the question; that the
only thing for me to do was to set you free."</p>

<p>"What did you say to her?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember. I probably raved like a
maniac."</p>

<p>"You did. Miss Stebbins, the secretary, was
in the library alcove, and she took short-hand
notes. It was terrible, Dick. You must have
been quite mad to say such things as you said to
Aunt Mehitable."</p>

<p>"I was mad. Look at it from my side for a
moment, if you can. I had just heard of the smash
in the Western mines, and right upon the heels of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
that I was calmly asked to give you up. Did she
show you the short-hand notes?"</p>

<p>"She did, after you had vanished without saying
a word to me or even writing a line to tell me what
had become of you. She did it to prove what she
had said many times before&mdash;that your ferocious
temper would make it impossible for any peaceable
person to live with you."</p>

<p>"And you&mdash;what did you do?"</p>

<p>"What could I do? I had to go on living; one
has to do that in any case. And after a time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"After a time, Jerry stepped in. I'm not
blaming anybody, Conetta, dear. If Jerry would
only break away from Beatrice Van Tromp and
treat you as he ought to treat the woman he is
going to marry, I wouldn't say a word."</p>

<p>She turned away, and for the length of time that
it took the <i>Andromeda</i> to sheer through three of
the long Caribbean swells she was silent. Then,
as if she were speaking to the wide expanse of sea
and starry sky: "It would be a tragedy if Jerry
should break away from Beatrice. They have
been engaged for ever and ever so long."</p>

<p>"What!" I exclaimed. "And you've known
it all the time?"</p>

<p>"I think you are the only one who hasn't known
it."</p>

<p>"But you said you and Jerry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," she interrupted coolly, "I didn't say it.
I merely let you go on believing what you seemed
to want to believe."</p>

<p>"But you did say that Jerry had asked you."</p>

<p>"That was a long time ago; and I think he did
it only because his uncle told him to."</p>

<p>Slowly the incredible thing battered its way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
into my brain. Conetta was free; free, and she
hadn't been any better able to forget than I had.
I slipped an arm around her.</p>

<p>"It's an awful gap&mdash;three years; could you&mdash;do
you suppose we could bridge it&mdash;and let Aunt
Mehitable make another will, if she wants to?"</p>

<p>Just then, Bonteck, or whoever had the wheel,
must have let the <i>Andromeda</i> fall off a bit.
There was a plunge, a splash, and the spray of the
curling bow wave showered us both. She let me
wipe her face with my handkerchief, and then put
it up to be kissed.</p>

<p>"There has never been any gap, Dick, dear,"
she said softly. "I&mdash;I guess I'm just a silly little
one-love fool. I've just been waiting&mdash;and waiting
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and Aunt Mehitable .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she's sorry,
dear; she's been sorry ever since that dreadful day
three years ago when she made you swear at her
and call her a mercenary old harridan.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>Time being the merest abstraction in such circumstances,
it might have been either minutes
or hours after this that the tubular chime which
answered for a ship's bell on the <i>Andromeda</i>
began to strike. Conetta counted, and as the
last note was dying away she chanted happily:</p>

<p>"Eight bells; the forward light is shining bright,
and all's well! Kiss me again, Dickie, dear, and
we'll go and find Aunt Mehitable&mdash;if she hasn't
gone to bed."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
